How Do I Use the CS Blueprints?Why the CS Methodology Matters (Internally)? Unifies client-facing efforts – Ensures all content (book, education, product, marketing, etc.) is aligned and consistent.? Enables consistent messaging – Provides every team with a shared foundation for how we communicate and deliver Customer Success.? Accelerates execution – Reduces ambiguity, speeds up onboarding, program development, and decision-making.? Establishes thought leadership – Positions ScalePad as a strategic leader in the MSP space through a precise and repeatable approach.? Supports scaling and collaboration – Acts as a common language across teams, enabling growth and cross-functional alignment.It's the backbone that ties strategy to execution across the company.How to Use This Blueprint (Based on Your Role at ScalePad)The CS Blueprints aren’t just internal references—they’re how we turn a complex MSP reality into a repeatable, scalable Customer Success motion. They provide each team—Product, Dev, Sales, CS, and Marketing—with a shared map for building, speaking, and executing the same strategy.This guide helps you read that map through your lens.The iPhone Analogy: Why We Build Complex to Deliver SimpleIs the iPhone a simple device? On the surface, absolutely—it’s intuitive, fluid, and elegant. But inside, it’s a masterwork of complexity: dozens of subsystems, sensors, APIs, integrations, and real-time data pipelines.We’re doing the same for Customer Success.From the MSP’s perspective, this methodology should feel like second nature: clear QBRs, aligned roadmaps, consistent client impact. However, for that to happen, we need to engineer objective complexity beneath the surface—smart defaults, adaptive segmentation, automated logic, data-driven insights, and a flexible UX.These blueprints are the foundation for that engineering. They translate MSP needs into systems logic—so the result feels as easy as the iPhone unlock screen, even if what’s running underneath is a jet engine.How to Navigate the BlueprintsThis reference guide supports the full CS methodology. Start by reading the Six Disciplines, which lay out the macro structure. Then dive into the blueprints to see how each discipline is implemented tactically: step-by-step workflows, logic models, terminology, and tooling support.Each blueprint is built like a module. Use it when you need clarity, need to prepare, or need to align multiple teams around a process.Warning: this goes deep. We integrate strategy, process design, client psychology, product logic, and outcome mapping into a single system. That’s by design—because no one’s ever done this for MSP CS.Feeling Overwhelmed? That’s Normal.If you feel like this is a lot, it is. If this were a formal education, it’d be at least a BSc in Customer Success Engineering for MSPs. But no university teaches this. We’re building the curriculum as we go.So here’s how to manage it:? Start with your role: The guide demonstrates ??how each section applies to what you do.? Use the Copilot: You don’t need to memorize the blueprints. Ask questions, request connections, or dig into specific logic—Copilot will help you extract precisely what you need, when you need it.? Build familiarity, not mastery: Use these like a GPS, not a textbook. You’re not expected to remember every detail—just know the map exists, and how to follow it.Living Documents, Evolving SystemThese blueprints aren’t carved in stone. They evolve based on market feedback, client innovation, internal iteration, and real-world results. If something isn’t landing, we revise. If MSPs invent a better way, we learn from it. This is an operational knowledge system, not a policy binder.We’re not just documenting best practices. We’re shaping them.So read, question, contribute, and let’s build the future of MSP Customer Success together.
Who is this for?DepartmentWhy it mattersProductAlign features, segmentation logic, and UI workflows with how MSPs think and operate. Blueprints reveal user mental models and expectations.DevelopmentTranslate CS process logic (e.g. quadrant scoring, playbook triggers) into backend logic or automation rules in LMx.MarketingExtract terminology, use cases, and segmentation language for campaigns, persona maps, and go-to-market messaging.SalesUse segmentation principles to frame value during demos, particularly for conversations about CS maturity. Helps position LMx as a scalable solution.Customer SuccessBlueprints guide real-world delivery. They define what CS professionals should do, how to do it, and why. These are the team’s operational playbooks.
How to Read a Blueprint Section-by-SectionEach blueprint follows a consistent logic. Here’s how to interpret it—and how different teams can act on each part:1. OverviewThis section defines the foundational context of the blueprint. It helps every team understand why the activity matters, what outcome it drives, and what operational or customer results to expect. It includes the following subsections:What is the objective?Defines the goal of the practice. Product: Use this to anchor feature alignment. Does the platform make this outcome easier? CS: Use this as your north star—if a task doesn’t serve this purpose, it’s out of scope. Marketing: Pull simple one-liners to explain feature value (e.g. “Helps MSPs segment clients based on maturity + financial value”).Why is it important?Explains the business impact and consequences of skipping this step. Sales: Use this to frame pain during qualification. What problems are MSPs facing without this? Marketing: Use this to write relevance-driven copy and content.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?Tactical justification tied to MSP operations. Product/Dev: Translate into “jobs to be done”—this is what the user is trying to achieve operationally. CS: Use this in onboarding or coaching. It’s how you explain the why behind your work.What is the Customer impact?Highlights how CS activity changes the client experience. CS: This explains what clients feel differently when you do it right. Helps anchor service delivery in outcomes. Sales: Position these as benefits when showing LMx features.2. Important Concepts ExplainedThis is the methodology layer—key concepts include the “quadrant model,” “maturity + appetite,” and “investment model.”Everyone: This is the thinking model we are operationalizing. Product: Align data models and UI to match this logic. Dev: Build any scoring logic, visualizations, or workflows around these concepts. CS: Teach these terms to clients—they are foundational.3. Strategy Decision ProcessThis section outlines the tactical execution path for the blueprint. Each implementation step is broken into actionable subsections to drive real-world adoption.Product/Dev: Use as the source logic for backend triggers, automation rules, or UI design. CS: This is your field manual—follow this during delivery, onboarding, or coaching. Sales: Reference this when explaining how the methodology works in practice. Marketing: Highlight successful implementations as case studies or training content.4. AppendixThis final section supports integration and system alignment. It covers how this blueprint links to other CS activities and what tooling support is currently available.How does it connect to the other parts?Illustrates how this tactic supports other CS pillars: Health, Process, Delivery, Strategy, etc. Product/Dev: Use this for roadmap dependency mapping and interface integrations. CS: Helps with sequencing and internal handoffs—when segmentation changes, other activities shift. Marketing: These connections are storylines—e.g., “How segmentation drives better budgeting.”Product Links / Tooling SupportWhat LMx currently supports—and what’s not automated yet. Product: Use this to assess the completeness of features. Dev: Understand where manual workarounds still exist. Sales: Set expectations and show value—e.g., “this logic is already in LMx, just not auto-scored yet.” CS: Explain when a step is manual vs. tool-driven, and how that’s changing.

Foundation to CS for MSPs
Foundation to CS for MSPs[1]This opening section represents the strategic foundation of ScalePad’s Customer Success for MSPs initiative. These first three chapters—Introduction to Customer Success for MSPs, Introduction to the 6 Disciplines, and Concepts—form the philosophical, structural, and operational core of the entire blueprint series. Together, they outline why this movement matters, how it works, and what must be in place for it to succeed on a large scale.The Introduction to Customer Success for MSPs explains the “why now” behind this transformation. It outlines the dual growth loops (for MSPs and clients), the shift from break-fix to strategic partnership, and the mounting expectations clients place on their providers. It also surfaces the core challenges MSPs face—from the failed promise of vCIOs to the misuse of QBRs—and reframes these as opportunities to differentiate through a structured Customer Success approach. This is not a theoretical exercise; it is a field-tested playbook for building trust, deepening relationships, and growing smarter, not just bigger.The Introduction to the 6 Disciplines defines the structural pillars of that playbook. It introduces the six integrated disciplines—Strategy, Health, Deliverables, Process, People, and Technology—that must align to guide client progression up the Client Goal Pyramid. Each discipline addresses a specific pain point in MSP-CS delivery, and together they form the basis of a repeatable, scalable, and measurable customer service (CS) operating system. From defining the right metrics and playbooks to aligning roles and tools, this framework enables every department—Product, Development, Customer Success, Marketing, and Sales—to speak a common language of value.Finally, the Concepts section serves as a primer for the mental model. It introduces the segmentation logic, quadrant model, maturity vs. appetite matrix, and Client Archetypes. These concepts enable MSPs to interpret client behaviour, define an engagement strategy, and align CS investments with business potential. Whether you're deciding cadence, selecting deliverables, or assigning roles, these models ground your choices in strategic logic, not gut feel.Customer Success for MSPs

Redefining Success: A Modern Introduction to Customer Success for MSPsBeyond MSPThe MSP industry is experiencing a radical realignment of value. What once sufficed—resolving tickets quickly, maintaining uptime, deploying technical fixes—has become insufficient in a world where clients now demand business outcomes, not technical deliverables. The traditional MSP 1.0 model, which emphasized responsiveness and technical mastery, has reached its limits.This shift has exposed a harsh reality for many MSPs: You can deliver flawless technical service without losing clients. Why? Because today’s clients are asking entirely new questions. They’re no longer interested only in stability and issue resolution. They want to know how technology can drive revenue, reduce risk, and give them a strategic edge. They want to know how their MSP partner is helping their business succeed, not just survive.MSPs have already navigated one major transformation—from break-fix to managed services. This was the first chasm, requiring MSPs to shift from hourly billing to recurring revenue and from a reactive to a proactive approach. Those who leaped created more scalable and predictable business models. But now, a second chasm has opened—a deeper, more strategic one. The leap this time isn’t about how you charge or deliver, but how you create value.This second chasm is the evolution from managed services to strategic enablement. From focusing on uptime and service response, to centring the conversation on business outcomes and measurable success. From operational excellence to strategic partnership. From tools and SLAs to insights and impact.To cross this chasm, MSPs must transform three things:1. Mindset – You’re not just a service provider but a growth partner.2. Engagement – You need to talk to executives, not just IT leads.3. Measurement – Your value must be tied to business metrics, not technical outputs.This isn’t a subtle change. It’s a reinvention. And for those who embrace it, the opportunity is enormous: MSPs become irreplaceable allies in business transformation, not interchangeable vendors.Bumper Sticker: Fixing printers got you here, but solving business problems will fuel your future.Introduction: Building Unbreakable PartnershipsThe MSP industry is standing at a strategic inflection point. Providers must decide: will they remain reactive vendors delivering commoditized services, or evolve into strategic partners who actively enable client growth and transformation?This decision has significant consequences. Clients are no longer content with uptime and incident response. They expect their MSPs to bring insight, strategic alignment, and proactive leadership. In other words, they want technology to serve as a business accelerator, not just a utility.The Client Goal Pyramid offers a framework for understanding how these expectations evolve. Inspired by Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, it visualizes a progression from foundational IT support to transformative business innovation:1. Tech Support – Keeping infrastructure stable, responsive helpdesk, uptime assurance.2. Tech Enablement – Optimizing tools, boosting productivity, enabling collaboration.3. Tech Modernization – Upgrading systems, adopting cloud, enhancing cybersecurity.4. Business Enablement – Aligning IT investments with business KPIs and goals.5. Business Innovation – Co-creating new capabilities, revenue streams, and competitive advantage.Most MSPs operate in the lower tiers. These tiers are operational and necessary, but also crowded and commoditized. Competing here often means competing on price, speed, or software bundle. It’s a zero-sum game with diminishing returns.The Commodity Trap and the ChasmThis operational focus creates a dangerous trap—commoditization. When clients perceive no meaningful difference between MSPs, the default decision driver becomes price. MSPs in the bottom tiers face this daily trap: constant RFPs, shrinking margins, and short-term loyalty. Excellent technical execution isn’t enough to stand out.To escape this trap, MSPs must cross a strategic chasm. They must shift from simply delivering services to driving measurable business impact. That means repositioning the MSP as a contributor to revenue, growth, innovation, and customer experience, not just IT performance.The Two Chasms: Moving from the Server Room to the BoardroomMSPs have already crossed one chasm in their history: the leap from break-fix to managed services. That transition established the recurring revenue model and built stability. But now, the next leap awaits—from managed services to strategic enablement.This second chasm demands a more profound transformation:? From technical fixes to business-aligned initiatives.? From conversations with IT coordinators to collaborations with CEOs, COOs, and CFOs.? From ticket metrics to outcome metrics.? From being a vendor to becoming an indispensable partner.Crossing this second chasm opens up a new relationship model where the MSP is in the boardroom, helping shape direction, not just in the server room, maintaining uptime.Strategic Differentiation Lives in the Upper PyramidStrategic differentiation lives in the upper tiers. Here, the MSP is no longer a vendor, but a trusted advisor. This is where MSPs gain boardroom access, help shape long-term planning, and become woven into their clients’ strategic direction.To ascend, MSPs must:? Build service offerings that support business KPIs, not just technical performance.? Develop cross-functional roles that facilitate strategic conversations.? Shift the structure of QBRs to focus on outcomes and strategic initiatives.? Measure value in terms of client success, not internal service efficiency alone.This transformation requires more than adding new tools or services. It demands a complete shift in mindset: away from managing infrastructure and toward guiding transformation. MSPs must build credibility through delivery, insight through discovery, and influence through consistency.Bumper Sticker: MSPs of tomorrow won't win with uptime; they'll win with impact.
How We Got Here - NO vCIOTo understand where MSPs are today, we must unpack how we got here. The current identity crisis many MSPs face—torn between tactical delivery and strategic partnership—can largely be traced back to the rise and subsequent misfire of the virtual CIO, or vCIO, role.The vCIO Was Dead on ArrivalThe vCIO started as a powerful idea: a fractional executive who bridges technology and business strategy. This role was supposed to bring executive-level insight, business acumen, and long-term vision to SMBs through their MSP. The vCIO would be the face of strategic alignment, guiding clients through risk, transformation, and opportunity.But reality turned out differently. In practice, the vCIO became a buzzword—a label attached to misaligned roles and unrealistic expectations. In some MSPs, it was assigned to overworked technical leads with no capacity for strategic work. In others, it was simply a dressed-up account manager role. In many cases, MSP owners wore the vCIO hat part-time, delivering fragmented strategy in between firefights.The result? Disillusionment. Clients quickly noticed the disconnect. The title said “strategic,” but the experience was tactical. Conversations remained stuck on renewals, tickets, and project updates: no insights, foresight, or measurable business value. The vCIO became an empty promise—more cosmetic than catalytic.The Historical Trap: From Reactive Support to Strategic PartnershipThis failure wasn’t just about a role—it revealed a deeper issue. MSPs lacked structure. There was no consistent framework for aligning delivery roles to client needs or scaling strategic engagement.Instead, key functions were scattered: Roadmaps, business reviews, lifecycle planning, and executive alignment were split between loosely defined roles—TAMs, AMs, engineers, project managers—all working reactively and independently.To fix this, MSPs need a structured approach that defines not only titles but also responsibilities, outcomes, and strategic contributions.Enter the Customer Success Quadrant Model:1. Business Operations (Top Left): CSMs and AMs manage retention, satisfaction, and service engagement.2. Strategic Business (Top Right): True vCIOs and advisors lead alignment with executive goals, innovation, and growth.3. Technology Operations (Bottom Left): TAMs and NOC/SOC teams ensure stable, secure, and compliant service delivery.4. Strategic Technology (Bottom Right): PMs and vCISOs drive modernization, lifecycle planning, and proactive risk management.An “Aha!” Moment: It’s All Customer SuccessHere’s the breakthrough: every quadrant supports Customer Success. Whether managing tickets or defining innovation strategies, all roles exist to help clients achieve meaningful and measurable outcomes.When MSPs recognize this, everything clicks:? Service delivery becomes outcome delivery.? Technical roles are aligned with business impact.? Strategic planning becomes structured and repeatable.? Clients experience clarity, consistency, and confidence.This is how MSPs move from chaos to clarity. From reactive execution to strategic enablement. From tactical IT providers to business growth partners.When every team member understands their quadrant, every client receives a unified, intentional experience. No more gaps. No more overlap. No more confusion.Bumper Sticker: Titles don’t matter. Strategic value does.
The Dual Growth LoopFunnels are dead. The real MSP growth engine is the post-sale experience. That’s where trust is built, outcomes are realized, and referrals are earned. Traditional sales funnels visualize the buyer's journey as ending at the point of purchase. But in a service business like MSPs, that’s just the beginning. The Bow Tie model reframes the journey to include a second, critical side: Acquisition ? Commitment ? Expansion.Once a contract is signed, the real opportunity begins—this is where the Dual Growth Loop comes into play. It describes how growth accelerates on both sides of the partnership: the MSP and the client. When properly executed, it creates a flywheel effect that builds unstoppable momentum.The Two Loops ExplainedClient FlywheelClients gain confidence in their MSP partner when they achieve measurable business outcomes, such as increased productivity, streamlined workflows, improved risk management, or enhanced market positioning. This leads to deeper trust, more strategic conversations, and a willingness to adopt more sophisticated services. The result? Clients become more successful, loyal, and willing to co-invest in long-term initiatives.MSP FlywheelAs clients grow and deepen their engagement, the MSP gains recurring revenue, increased retention, and better profitability. Success stories and trust-based relationships lead to referrals and new opportunities. Operational efficiencies improve as standardized processes and tools are implemented across a more mature client base. Your team transitions from reactive fire-fighting to proactive value delivery. The business becomes more scalable, resilient, and differentiated.These two loops feed each other. As clients achieve results, they grow, and as they grow, they require more from the MSP. That growth generates new revenue and insights, which in turn fuel better services. It's a virtuous cycle of mutual success.Operationalizing the Dual Growth LoopTo make this loop more than a theory, MSPs must install key practices:? Structured Onboarding: Create early momentum by delivering immediate value. First impressions define the trajectory.? Strategic Cadence: Hold regular business reviews that are outcome-focused, not just operational check-ins.? Impact Reporting: Stop tracking only tickets and SLAs. Track progress against business goals and strategic milestones.? Clear Roles: Empower customer success managers (CSMs), technical account managers (TAMs), and vCIOs to own their strategy, not just delivery.? Standardized Playbooks: Use repeatable processes that deliver consistent success across client segments.Strategic Benefits of the ModelWhen implemented, the Dual Growth Loop doesn't just boost retention—it transforms the entire business model:? From transactional to relational engagement? From linear sales to circular expansion? From vendor status to strategic partner roleBumper Sticker: Real growth begins after the contract is signed. And it never stops.
Evolution of Client ExpectationsThe business landscape is evolving—and so are client expectations. As digital transformation accelerates across industries, the definition of value is shifting. No longer is IT simply seen as a utility that supports operations. Technology is now a primary driver of growth, differentiation, and competitive advantage for modern clients.Historically, clients measured success in terms of stability: Are systems running? Is downtime low? Are tickets resolved quickly? These expectations aligned with the traditional MSP delivery model: efficient, responsive, and technically competent. However, this operational view is now a table stake.Today’s clients expect more than reliability—they want relevance. They want proactive guidance, strategic insight, and measurable contributions to their business outcomes. They don’t just want their technology to work—they want it to work for them, advancing their goals, enabling their vision, and opening new opportunities.This evolution didn’t happen overnight. It’s been driven by several converging forces:? The mainstreaming of cloud services and SaaS platforms.? The increasing role of AI, data analytics, and automation.? Heightened expectations for digital experiences.? Competitive pressure to innovate or be left behind.? The consumerization of business services: seamless, fast, and personalized.MSPs can no longer rely on technical excellence in this new landscape. Clients want partners who understand their market, business model, and constraints and can help them navigate a path forward.This is where the Client Goal Pyramid becomes a critical tool. It helps MSPs map their clients’ current mindset and maturity, and design services that meet them where they are, while guiding them up the pyramid toward strategic enablement and innovation.The five stages of client evolution each reflect a distinct mindset:1. Tech Support: "Just keep things working."2. Tech Enablement: "Help us do more with what we have."3. Tech Modernization: "We need to future-proof and stay competitive."4. Business Enablement: "We want IT aligned with measurable business priorities.”5. Business Innovation: "We want to lead in our industry through technology."Most clients begin at the bottom and aspire to move up. But their ability to do so depends on trust, education, and shared success. MSPs must take on the role of translator, educator, and guide—explaining the value of strategic IT and showing clients how to ascend confidently.MSPs that fail to recognize this evolution risk becoming irrelevant. Those who cling to reactive models will find their services commoditized and their client relationships vulnerable to exploitation. But those who embrace the shift—and structure their services, roles, and metrics accordingly—will earn a seat at the strategy table.This shift is both a challenge and an opportunity. It forces MSPs to upskill, restructure, and rethink how they deliver value. But it also opens the door to deeper partnerships, longer retention, and more impactful engagements.Bumper Sticker: Today’s clients demand outcomes and experiences, not just uptime.
Navigating the Pyramid: The Journey of GrowthEvery client is on a journey. But no two start in the same place. Some seek reliability. Others seek reinvention. MSPs must identify the starting point and act as a guide, not a pusher.Progress is earned. Trust is built through outcomes. And growth comes from walking with your clients, not running ahead of them.This journey must be:? Mapped – Where is the client now?? Personalized – What is their next best step?? Measured – What outcomes prove progress?Client Archetypes: Meeting Clients Where They AreStrategic engagement starts with segmentation. Two traits define every client:? Technology Maturity – Are their systems and practices advanced?? Appetite for Change – Are They Ready to Evolve?These define four archetypes:? Transform (High/High): Develop a demand strategy and lead the conversation.? Modernize (Low/High): Need guidance and trust-building.? Educate (High/Low): Require inspiration and evidence.? Sustain (Low/Low): Limit investment and monitor carefully.Your approach should adapt. Don’t oversell to the risk-averse. Don’t underserve the ambitious. Strategic alignment starts with understanding.The Experience Economy: Raising the Bar for MSPsClients now expect experiences, not transactions. They want to be understood, heard, and guided. They expect digital polish, responsive communication, and strategic insight.Winning MSPs master:? Empathy – Understanding the business and human context.? Storytelling – Framing insights in compelling narratives.? Proactivity – Solving tomorrow’s problems today.This is the new battleground. In a commoditized market, a strong client experience is your competitive advantage. Not tools. Not prices. Not speed.Final Note: Everything that follows in this guide builds on these principles. The CS blueprints will provide you with the tools to apply these insights and design a modern, scalable, and strategic Customer Success function tailored for MSP growth over the next decade.
Why Methodology Matters — And Why We’ve Never Had OneThe Broken Promise of Customer SuccessThe MSP world is full of well-intentioned efforts. We see strategic planning decks, QBRs branded as vCIO insights, and one-off webinars trying to explain customer value. But here’s the truth: most of it is disconnected, inconsistent, and nearly impossible to scale.Why?Because there has been no unified methodology, we’ve had fragments — education in pockets, products that promised transformation, and a parade of best practices with no underlying architecture. But nothing tied it all together.? No shared language.? No structured workflows.? No repeatable system for client impact.So MSPs, despite the right intent, end up stuck: constantly reinventing the wheel, over-relying on individual heroes, and living in a perpetual state of client engagement improvisation.This isn’t a failure of effort. It’s a failure of design.What Is a Methodology?Let’s define the term so we’re on the same page:A methodology is more than a process. It’s a blueprint — a set of principles, practices, and decision frameworks that turn chaos into consistency.In the context of MSP Customer Success, a methodology would:? Define the key disciplines required for long-term success.? Create a shared structure for who does what, when, and how.? Align every action — from ticket to roadmap — to a client outcome.? Enable coaching, training, and tooling to reinforce behaviour at scale.Think of it as a franchise model for trust. The same client experience, whether delivered by your top TAM or your newest CSM. Not because they’re equally talented, but because the system carries the weight.Without methodology, you’re building on sand. With it, you’re building on bedrock.What Happens Without One?When methodology is missing, three patterns emerge:1. Education becomes orphaned. Great ideas from webinars or peer groups never make it into workflows. There’s no connective tissue between what the team hears and what the team does.2. Product becomes shelfware. Tools like Lifecycle Manager, ControlMap, or Quoter are powerful. But without a framework to embed them in a repeatable process, they become reporting engines, not impact engines.3. Client experience becomes inconsistent. Some clients get strategic planning. Others get quarterly ticket recaps. Even the same CSM can deliver wildly different value depending on the week. Trust becomes unpredictable—expansion stalls.This is the root of MSP fatigue. Not just the work itself, but the constant reinvention, the lack of leverage, the feeling that you’re always one hire or one fire away from collapse.What Would a Methodology Unlock?A real Customer Success Methodology would change the game.? Clarity: Everyone on the team knows what good looks like.? Consistency: Every client gets a strategic experience, every time.? Confidence: QBRs become decision-making moments, not status updates.? Compounding Impact: Each success story feeds the Growth Loop.Imagine if onboarding always turned into planning. If planning always turned into outcomes. And if outcomes always turn into trust and expansion.That’s not a tool problem. That’s a methodology problem. And it’s solvable.From Confusion to CompassThis book exists because we’ve seen this pattern repeatedly play out: MSPs want to be strategic, but they lack the scaffolding to execute that strategy at scale.The six disciplines that follow are not theoretical in nature. They are field-tested. They are aligned with real client goals. And they are designed to work across your entire business, not just in quarterly meetings, but in every conversation, touchpoint, and initiative.We believe Customer Success isn’t a department — it’s a system.And systems need a methodology.Let’s build one together.Bumper Sticker: “You can’t scale trust without structure.”

When clients see no meaningful difference between MSPs, price becomes the primary decision driver. This is the commodity trap: constant RFPs, shrinking margins, short-term loyalty. Technical execution is no longer enough.

The second chasm—from managed services to strategic enablement—requires a shift in how value is created and perceived:? From technical fixes to business-aligned initiatives? From IT coordinators to C-level collaboration? From uptime metrics to impact metrics? From vendor status to strategic partnerCrossing this chasm positions the MSP in the boardroom, influencing business direction and outcomes.Bumper Sticker:Fixing printers got you here, but solving business problems will fuel your future.
2. MSP Market Challenges and OpportunitiesEvolution of Client ExpectationsThe business landscape is evolving—and so are client expectations. As digital transformation accelerates, the definition of value is shifting. No longer is IT simply a utility; it is now seen as a strategic enabler of business outcomes. Historically, success was measured by stability: uptime, response time, and resolution. But now, those are merely table stakes.Today’s clients expect relevance. They want proactive guidance, strategic foresight, and measurable contributions to business performance. They don’t just want their technology to work—they want it to move their business forward. They want MSPs who understand their market, model, and mission.Several forces have driven this shift:? Mainstream adoption of cloud and SaaS? Rising importance of AI and data insights? Demand for seamless digital experiences? Pressure to innovate quickly? Consumer-like expectations in B2B servicesThis is where the Client Goal Pyramid becomes a critical toolThe Client Goal Pyramid models the evolution of client needs, from basic IT support to strategic innovation. It provides MSPs with a diagnostic framework to assess current client positioning and map a growth journey. The five levels are:? Tech Support: Keep things working? Tech Enablement: Improve productivity and collaboration? Tech Modernization: Future-proof systems and security? Business Enablement: Align IT with business KPIs? Business Innovation: Drive competitive advantage and new value streamsClients aspire to move up, but progress depends on trust, education, and shared outcomes. The MSP’s role is to guide that journey.Client Archetypes: Meeting Clients Where They AreClients can be segmented along two axes: Technology Maturity and Appetite for Change. This yields four archetypes:? Transform (High Maturity / High Appetite): ready for strategic partnership? Modernize (Low Maturity / High Appetite): eager to grow but needs guidance? Educate (High Maturity / Low Appetite): capable but hesitant; needs vision? Sustain (Low Maturity / Low Appetite): risk-averse; maintain and monitorMSPs must adapt their approach based on the archetype. Overselling to conservative clients or underserving ambitious ones creates misalignment.The Experience Economy: Raising the Bar for MSPsClients no longer evaluate partners purely on deliverables—they assess experiences. They expect to be understood, heard, and led. Winning MSPs master:? Empathy: Understand business context and user needs? Storytelling: Translate insights into actionable narratives? Proactivity: Anticipate and solve problems before they ariseIn a market of technical parity, experience becomes the differentiator. Not tools. Not speed. Not even price.Navigating the Pyramid: The Journey of GrowthClient evolution is a journey, not a push. MSPs must:? Map: Understand the client's current state? Personalize: Define the next best step? Measure: Track progress with business outcomesGrowth is a shared process. Walk with your clients. Build trust. Deliver results. That is how MSPs become strategic growth partners.Bumper Sticker:Today’s clients demand outcomes and experiences, not just uptime.
3. What’s Missing from MSP GrowthThe Dual Growth LoopTraditional sales funnels visualize the buyer journey as ending at the point of sale. But in MSP services, that’s just the beginning. The real growth engine lies in what happens after the contract is signed: the delivery, results, and strategic expansion. This is where the Bow Tie model comes in—transforming the funnel into a Dual Growth Loop.The Two Loops ExplainedClient Flywheel: As clients experience measurable business outcomes—higher productivity, reduced risk, improved agility—trust grows. That trust fuels deeper engagement, increased adoption, and willingness to co-invest in strategic initiatives.MSP Flywheel: As clients grow, MSPs gain increased retention, more upsell opportunities, improved margins, and standardized processes. Strategic engagements become repeatable. Success becomes scalable. The MSP moves from reactive execution to proactive orchestration.These loops reinforce one another. Client success drives MSP growth. MSP maturity enables deeper client value. It’s a mutually accelerating cycle.Operationalizing the Dual Growth LoopTo make this real, MSPs must operationalize the model through structured practices:? Structured Onboarding: Create value early to build trust and momentum? Strategic Cadence: Hold regular business reviews that focus on client goals, not tickets? Impact Reporting: Track metrics that reflect progress toward outcomes? Clear Roles: Empower CSMs, TAMs, and vCIOs with ownership over outcomes? Standardized Playbooks: Use repeatable methods to deliver success at scaleStrategic Benefits of the ModelThe Dual Growth Loop unlocks:? Relational, not transactional, client engagement? Circular, not linear, revenue expansion? Trusted advisor positioning, not vendor statusThis model transforms both the client journey and the MSP’s own business evolution.Bumper Sticker: Real growth begins after the contract is signed. And it never stops.
4. Why Customer Success is HardHow We Got Here – NO vCIOTo understand why Customer Success is difficult for MSPs, we need to revisit a key turning point: the failed promise of the virtual CIO (vCIO) role. Originally envisioned as a strategic guide for small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), the vCIO was intended to bridge business goals with technology strategy. Instead, it became a buzzword—misapplied, misaligned, and misunderstood.The vCIO Was Dead on ArrivalIn many MSPs, the vCIO role was handed over to overburdened technical leads or mislabeled account managers. Owners played the role part-time. As a result, clients were promised strategic insight but received tactical check-ins. There was no structure, no foresight, and no business value. The vCIO title became cosmetic—a promise unfulfilled.The Historical Trap: From Reactive Support to Strategic PartnershipThe vCIO failure revealed a deeper flaw: the absence of structural alignment between roles and outcomes. Business reviews, lifecycle planning, and strategic alignment were scattered across TAMs, AMs, engineers, and project managers—each operating reactively, without coordination.To shift from chaos to clarity, MSPs need a proper framework. Not just new titles, but clear responsibilities, defined processes, and aligned outcomes.Bumper Sticker: Titles don’t matter. Strategic value does.
5. Rethinking the QBRFrom Tactical Review to Strategic MomentumMost QBRs in the MSP space focus on past performance: ticket counts, uptime statistics, and asset inventories. But the best QBRs look forward. They use the meeting as a launchpad for strategic conversations, goal alignment, and long-term planning.To make QBRs matter, they must evolve from status updates to strategy sessions. That means:? Connecting every insight to business outcomes? Framing each win as a step toward future initiatives? Replacing retrospective checklists with forward-looking discussionsThe QBR as a Growth EngineWhen redefined, the QBR becomes a key driver in the Customer Success journey. It creates rhythm, builds trust, and unlocks new business. MSPs should:? Use client goals as the anchor of every agenda? Introduce new opportunities through the lens of value, not features? Align initiatives with the Client Goal Pyramid and maturity levelDone right, QBRs catalyze transformation. They elevate the conversation from technical support to strategic leadership.Bumper Sticker: Turn service reviews into strategy sessions. Make every meeting matter.
6. Financial Impact of Customer SuccessBeyond Client Count: Revenue Expansion through SuccessMany MSPs believe growth comes from adding more clients. However, sustainable growth in a mature service business comes from deepening relationships and expanding within the existing base. That means increasing Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and achieving high Net Dollar Retention (NDR).Understanding the Metrics? Gross Dollar Retention (GDR): Measures how much revenue you retain from existing clients, excluding expansion—a solid indicator of churn control.? Net Dollar Retention (NDR): This metric includes upsells, cross-sells, and expansions. Reflects the total value increase per client.Best-in-class MSPs operate at 105 %+ NDR. Top SaaS benchmarks hit 120%. This means you don’t need more clients to grow—you need to expand smarter.Structured Success = Faster GrowthResearch shows that MSPs with a structured Customer Success methodology grow 60% faster on average. Why?? Higher retention and lower churn? More predictable expansion? Reduced reliance on new logo acquisitionCustomer Success isn’t just a department—it’s a multiplier for recurring revenue, lifetime value, and overall business health.Bumper Sticker: You don’t need more clients to grow—you need to expand smarter.
7. Building a Customer Success MethodologyWhy Methodology Matters — And Why We’ve Never Had OneMSPs have long pursued strategic value, but most efforts are ad hoc, characterized by unscalable QBR decks, inconsistent client planning, and disconnected insights. The real issue? No shared methodology.Customer Success isn’t failing because of a lack of effort—it’s failing from a lack of structure. Without a guiding system, teams rely on heroics and improvisation. The result is inconsistency, inefficiency, and fatigue.What Is a Methodology?A methodology is a system of principles, practices, and frameworks that:? Defines the disciplines of long-term success? Assigns clear ownership across roles and responsibilities? Aligns every action to a client outcome? Enables training, tooling, and scaleThink of it like a franchise model for trust: consistency in experience, regardless of which team member delivers it. Without methodology, success is fragile. With it, success becomes predictable.What Happens Without One?? Education gets lost. Great ideas from peer groups never become a process.? Tools become shelfware. Platforms like Lifecycle Manager and ControlMap lack impact without structured integration.? Experience becomes inconsistent. Clients receive varied treatment, trust erodes, and expansion stalls.What Would a Methodology Unlock?? Clarity: Everyone knows what good looks like.? Consistency: Every client receives strategic value.? Confidence: QBRs drive decisions, not just reviews.? Compounding Impact: Wins fuel the Growth Loop.From Confusion to CompassThe six Customer Success disciplines outlined in this guide are not theoretical; they are practical. They’re field-tested, scalable, and outcome-driven. They work across roles, engagements, and lifecycle stages.Customer Success is not a department. It’s a system. And every system needs a methodology to scale.Bumper Sticker:You can’t scale trust without structure.
8. Understanding Client and Tech NeedsThis is where the Client Goal Pyramid becomes a critical toolThe Client Goal Pyramid maps the evolution of client expectations from technical stability to business innovation. It gives MSPs a visual framework for assessing client maturity and aligning services to match:? Tech Support: "Keep things working."? Tech Enablement: "Help us do more with what we have."? Tech Modernization: "Help us stay secure and current"? Business Enablement: "Make IT serve our business goals"? Business Innovation: "Help us lead our industry through technology"Progression up the pyramid requires trust, clarity, and a sense of value. MSPs must guide—not push—clients upward.Technology Maturity vs. Appetite for Change MatrixTwo key traits define client readiness:? Technology Maturity: How sophisticated are their systems and practices?? Appetite for Change: How eager are they to evolve?This creates four client archetypes:? Transform: High maturity / high appetite — demand strategic leadership? Modernize: Low maturity / high appetite — ready for growth, needs structure? Educate: High maturity / low appetite — capable, but cautious? Sustain: Low maturity / low appetite — requires stability and monitoringClient ArchetypesEach archetype requires a tailored approach:? Transform: Co-create initiatives, push boundaries? Modernize: Provide structure, build confidence? Educate: Share evidence, inspire action? Sustain: Maintain reliability, identify future potentialThe MSP's RoleMSPs must act as interpreters and guides. Translate business goals into technology strategies. Recommend the next step that is most suitable, not the most impressive one. Listen, segment, and personalize. That’s how you earn trust and drive real impact.
9. Strategic Shift: From Server Room to BoardroomStrategic Differentiation Lives in the Upper PyramidTrue differentiation happens when MSPs move beyond operational delivery and become embedded in their clients’ strategic planning. This shift elevates the MSP from tactical problem solver to strategic business partner.To operate in the upper tiers of the Client Goal Pyramid, MSPs must:? Offer services tied to business KPIs and measurable outcomes? Facilitate executive-level conversations, not just technical reviews? Use every QBR to build forward-looking plans, not just recap performance? Frame technology investments in terms of growth, risk, and innovationThis isn’t just about speaking the language of business—it’s about proving value in business terms.To Ascend, MSPs Must? Deliver consistently at the operational level to earn trust? Bring insight and strategic context through structured discovery? Use frameworks like the Growth Loop and Client Goal Pyramid to guide engagement? Equip team members with the tools, narratives, and cadence to operate at a strategic altitudeBoardroom-level engagement isn’t reserved for enterprise IT firms. It’s available to every MSP who can demonstrate alignment, value, and foresight.From Tactical to TransformationalThis is the new MSP identity:? From reactive to proactive? From IT support to business enablement? From technical advisor to strategic catalystBumper Sticker: Boardroom MSPs don’t just fix problems. They shape outcomes.
10. Final Note: Start Small, Make a Big ImpactLet’s Build It TogetherYou don’t have to redesign your entire MSP business overnight. Start with one client. Apply the principles from this guide. Test the frameworks. Refine your messaging. See what’s possible when Customer Success becomes intentional and repeatable.The transformation from vendor to strategic partner begins with a shift in mindset.

Disciplines - CS Revolution for MSPs'The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old, but on building the new.' — Socrates.  Unlocking Customer Success: The Six Essential Disciplines for MSP TransformationThe old models won't work in today’s hyper-competitive MSP landscape. You’ve felt the constant pressure to deliver more value, rise above commoditization, and move beyond merely fixing problems to becoming a trusted strategic partner for your clients. But this transformation doesn’t happen by chance; it demands intentionality, structure, and clarity. It requires a new way of thinking, powered by a disciplined methodology that puts customer success at its core.The journey from reactive vendor to proactive partner isn’t easy. But we’ve seen it work again and again. The MSPs winning today have adopted a structured approach to Customer Success, centred on six key disciplines that guide their actions and interactions. These disciplines form a robust framework to deliver measurable business outcomes, foster loyalty, drive differentiation, and elevate your MSP from commodity provider to indispensable partner.Have you ever tried to hit a golf ball straight down the fairway? If you have, you know there are at least four things you must get right:1. Choose the right club for the distance and lie, just as you must pick the right business goal to pursue with a client.2. Address the ball—stance, alignment, and posture, just as you must set up your team, data, and process to align with that goal.3. Grip the club correctly, just as you need a solid playbook and tools in your CS toolkit.4. Swing on the right path—follow through just as you must execute with discipline and rhythm.Miss any one of those, and your ball slices into the rough. In Customer Success, the stakes are even higher: you’re not hitting a ball by yourself, you’re orchestrating a team of CSMs, vCIOs, engineers and your client’s stakeholders. Every element—from goal?setting to follow?up—must work together, every time.This book will show you how to build that repeatable, integrated “swing” so you not only hit the ball, but drive measurable business impact for every client.
The Five Levels of Client GoalsRather than a generic “maturity” scale, we anchor our program in what clients want to achieve. The MSP's role and your CS approach must shift as they move from basic IT support to true innovation.1. Level 1: Technology Support Deliver reliable monitoring, backups, incident response and basic reporting—so clients feel confident that the lights stay on.2. Level 2: Technology Enablement Drive discrete projects and align tools—onboarding new applications, improving security posture—so clients can operate more smoothly.3. Level 3: Technology Modernization Standardize platforms, close gaps, and adopt best?in?class solutions—so clients know they’re protected and future?ready.4. Level 4: Business Transformation Leverage technology to streamline processes, boost productivity, and automate routine work, so clients can shift their teams to higher?value tasks.5. Level 5: Business Innovation Co?author strategic roadmaps, pilot emerging tech (AI, advanced analytics), and embed innovation into the culture, so clients gain a true competitive advantage.As clients progress through these five levels, your CS program must evolve: from different deliverables to deeper engagements, new playbooks, fresh metrics, and ultimately, a seat at the client’s strategy table.
Introducing the Six?Discipline CS MethodologyTo guide clients through those five levels—and to ensure you never leave any element to chance—we organize everything into six integrated disciplines. Think of them as the six facets of your “swing”:1. CS Strategy - Define how you’ll segment clients, package services, and allocate capacity so clients get the right experience for their goal level.2. CS Health - Choose and track a few metrics—adoption, engagement, satisfaction, service quality, and alignment—to know exactly where each client stands.3. CS Deliverables - Build the right artifacts—reports, assessments, budgets, strategic plans, roadmaps—that connect directly to client goals and CS Health.4. CS Process - Standardize your workflows—playbooks, triggers, preparation, delivery, follow?up—so every meeting and milestone is purposeful, consistent, and scalable.5. CS People - Staff and structure your team—roles, responsibilities, enablement, compensation, governance—around the goals and processes you’ve defined.6. CS Technology - Implement the tools and integrations that automate routine tasks, surface insights and keep everyone aligned on the same real?time data.These six disciplines don’t live in isolation—they form a hexagon of capability. Each client engagement is a cycle:? Annual strategy and goal?setting (Disciplines 1 & 6)? Quarterly health reviews and roadmap updates (Disciplines 2 & 3)? Weekly process execution and follow?up (Discipline 4)? Ongoing people enablement and tech tuning (Disciplines 5 & 6)In the following chapters, we’ll dive into each discipline—step by step—so you can master the art and science of Customer Success for MSPs, level by level.
1. Understanding Client Goals: The Foundation of All SuccessEvery successful Customer Success (CS) methodology begins with a clear understanding of your client’s business goals. After all, technology itself isn’t the end goal; it’s merely a means to achieving something bigger. Whether it’s seamless operations, modernization, process transformation, or market innovation, every client has unique objectives guiding their technology decisions.By deeply understanding these goals, you can tailor your approach and services to their strategic priorities. This alignment shifts your conversations from technical jargon about servers and bandwidth to strategic dialogue about growth, efficiency, and competitive advantage. It elevates your MSP from technical expert to strategic enabler.We’ve identified five distinct levels of client goals, ranging from basic operational support to business innovation. Whether clients simply want smooth-running systems or seek transformative market leadership, knowing exactly where they stand on this spectrum helps you deliver the right conversations, insights, and deliverables at the right time.2. Measuring the Right Things: Customer Success HealthOnce you understand what success looks like for your clients, measuring progress toward these goals becomes critical. This discipline defines clear, relevant metrics for client health beyond basic SLA reports and trouble tickets. Measuring customer health means tracking client experience, technology adoption, engagement, service quality, and service alignment. It’s about seeing the complete picture of how your client benefits from your services and pinpointing where they might encounter obstacles.Imagine knowing exactly which clients are thriving and which are at risk. Imagine proactively identifying when a client starts to disengage before they consider leaving. This insight allows you to intervene early, adjust your approach, and continuously improve the client’s journey. It’s not about numbers for numbers’ sake; it’s about information that empowers meaningful action.3. Delivering Tangible Value: Customer Success DeliverablesClients today crave more than just conversations; they need tangible evidence of the value you provide. This is where CS Deliverables come into play—clear, structured, consistent outputs such as reports, strategic assessments, budgets, action-oriented plans, and roadmaps.These deliverables aren’t just paperwork. They’re powerful tools that capture your strategic insights and recommendations, aligning your MSP’s activities with the client’s long-term business outcomes. Whether creating a multi-year technology budget, providing detailed compliance assessments, or delivering strategic innovation roadmaps, your deliverables clearly illustrate your value in terms that your client’s executives understand and appreciate.Strong deliverables become a regular part of client interactions, creating transparency, accountability, and trust. They shift the perception of your MSP from a reactive service provider to a proactive strategic advisor.4. Creating Consistency: Customer Success ProcessesConsistency is critical to scaling Customer Success effectively. Without clearly defined processes, every client interaction becomes unpredictable and inconsistent. Good intentions aren’t enough; MSPs must establish repeatable workflows that ensure disciplined execution across every client touchpoint.This discipline involves creating standardized playbooks for onboarding, quarterly business reviews (QBRs), strategic planning sessions, and crisis management. It means establishing clear triggers to initiate proactive engagements, preparing thoroughly before every client interaction, and always closing the loop with disciplined follow-up.When processes are clear and consistent, your team can operate with confidence. Clients feel understood, valued, and supported at every step. Over time, this consistency builds trust, reinforces your value, and positions your MSP as a dependable strategic partner, rather than just another vendor.5. Empowering Your Team: Customer Success PeopleBehind every excellent Customer Success methodology lies a dedicated, empowered team. Your team members, not the technology alone, drive your client’s experience. Defining roles is essential, providing the tools and training your people need, and incentivizing their performance in ways aligned with client success outcomes.This discipline means clarifying who handles what, from Technical Account Managers (TAMs) monitoring day-to-day service quality, to virtual Chief Information Officers (vCIOs) driving strategic alignment, to dedicated Customer Success Managers (CSMs) ensuring overall client health and engagement. Each role must be clearly defined, trained, and empowered to deliver on your customer success promise.When your team knows exactly their responsibilities and how their performance is measured, they’re positioned to deliver consistently excellent experiences. They become advocates for your clients, proactively solving problems and seeking opportunities to add strategic value.6. Leveraging Technology to Scale: Customer Success ToolsFinally, the right technology infrastructure must support your Customer Success strategy. While technology itself is never the whole solution, it’s essential for scaling your CS operations, improving efficiency, and enabling data-driven decisions.Leveraging technology means integrating platforms that help you manage client portfolios, track health metrics, automate reporting, and streamline processes. It includes tools to manage playbooks, document deliverables, and ensure consistent client experiences. Increasingly, it also means embracing AI-driven insights to identify risks, opportunities, and strategic recommendations proactively.With powerful technology supporting your team, your MSP can scale customer success without sacrificing quality. It frees your people to spend less time managing administrative details and more time engaging clients, solving strategic problems, and driving innovation.What Makes This Methodology Work?MSPs often appear identical on the surface—offering similar services, technologies, and even organizational charts—but the subtle nuances make massive operational and strategic differences. What works for a small shop with one technician moonlighting as AM, TAM, and vCIO won’t translate to a larger MSP with defined CS roles across a matrixed team.Our methodology works because it acknowledges these differences. It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach—it’s a modular system powered by MSP Archetypes. Whether you're an owner-operator wearing every hat, a team with a dedicated Account Manager, or a mature CS organization with vCIOs, vCISOs, and strategic teams, this methodology adapts to you.We’ve also embedded Client Archetypes, which help tailor CS engagement based on the client's technology maturity and business appetite, ranging from support-focused to innovation-driven organizations.This methodology is robust because:? It leverages best practices already in use by leading Managed Service Providers (MSPs)—then orchestrates them into a single, adoptable system.? It supports a gradual path to execution excellence, allowing you to start small and evolve at your own pace.It drives alignment between business goals and technical deliverables, making customer success a measurable, strategic function.When applied consistently, the methodology delivers predictability, scalability, and genuine business impact for both MSP and client. Methodology Design AssumptionsCustomer Success isn’t one-size-fits-all. If we ignore the messy, real-world dynamics of how MSPs and clients operate, any methodology will collapse under the weight of theory. These assumptions ground the framework in truth: MSPs are diverse, clients evolve at different paces, and success is built through alignment, not abstraction. By designing for reality, not fantasy, we ensure this system works whether you're a solo operator managing five clients or a CS leader scaling strategic outcomes across hundreds. These principles don’t just shape the methodology—they protect it from becoming shelfware.1. MSP Archetypes Are Real - MSPs vary in terms of size, structure, and maturity. Our methodology assumes you might be a one-person CS team or a matrixed organization, and it adapts accordingly.2. Client Archetypes Shape Engagement - We design around client maturity and appetite for technology: Supporters, Enablers, Modernizers, Transformers, and Innovators.3. Commitment to Service Excellence - The MSP is committed to becoming its clients’ most valuable partner, not just a vendor.4. Client Success Drives MSP Success - Success is no longer just about uptime, but about delivering measurable business impact and proving your strategic value.5. Innovation is a Shared Responsibility - MSPs and clients share the responsibility of evolving; products, services, and delivery models must keep pace with market shifts.6. The CS Role Is Multifaceted - CS isn’t one person—it’s a set of roles (AM, vCIO, vCISO, vCTO, TAM) united by a shared purpose: enabling, aligning, and innovating.7. People Are Wired to Solve Problems - Our system empowers the people closest to the client to identify and solve real business problems.8. Data-Informed Engagement Wins - Gut Feel and Goodwill Aren't Enough. Data—about health, adoption, engagement, and outcomes—must guide action. Methodology Design RequirementsA methodology is only as robust as it is practical. These design requirements serve as the guardrails that transform strategic intent into daily execution. They ensure the system is scalable, data-driven, and AI-native from day one—because time, not willpower, is the real enemy of Customer Success. By reducing friction, embedding habits, and aligning people to outcomes, we create a framework that works in motion, not just theory. This isn’t about adding work; it’s about architecting a system that does the job with you. When every team, tool, and touchpoint reinforces the same goal—client success—you deliver not just value, but also a unified approach. You compound it.1. AI First - The most significant barrier of CS is the requirement of time to understand clients, prepare meetings, create follow-ups, all of which can be supported by well-designed AI2. Make It Easier - Reduce friction. Use tools, templates, and workflows that minimize overhead and maximize outcomes.3. Think Holistically About the Business - See the client’s full context, including strategy, operations, risk, and goals, and map technology for business purposes.4. Be Process-Driven - Utilize standardized processes and playbooks to ensure consistency and scalability, tailored to each client segment.5. Establish Habits - Anchor CS in recurring cadences: QBRs, strategic planning, roadmap reviews, etc.6. Promote Continuous Innovation - Always seek better ways to serve clients—productize improvements, refine playbooks, launch new value.7. Instill Constructive Accountability - Define what “winning” looks like. Align teams to measurable client outcomes and shared ownership.8. Build a Measurement Culture - Measure what matters—client health, adoption, engagement, experience—and act on insights.9. Proactively Pursue Alignment - Utilize strategy, data, and cadence to keep everyone focused on shared goals, rather than just reactive tasks.10. Encourage Effective Communication Create clear channels, templates, and structures to promote client collaboration and internal alignment.11. Leverage Technology - Use CS tools that support visibility, repeatability, and decision-making across all teams and clients.Reading Tips for 'Customer Success Methodology for MSPs'Read This Through Your LensThis methodology isn’t just for one role—it’s a system designed to serve every player in the client success game.

Client Business GoalsThe Foundation of Customer SuccessThe 5 Levels of Client Business Goals1.1. Technology Support1.2. Technology Enablement1.3. Technology Modernization (Where most MSPs operate today)1.4. Business Transformation1.5. Business Innovation
The Foundation of Customer SuccessAt the heart of a modern Customer Success strategy for MSPs lies one crucial question: “What are our clients trying to achieve with technology?”Answering this question is the starting point for every high-impact CS program. Even the most polished deliverables, processes, or tools risk missing the mark if they fail to reflect the client’s business priorities.Clearly defined business goals help MSPs:? Align technology initiatives with business outcomes? Tailor CS activities to each client’s maturity and strategic appetite? Measure value based on business impact, not just service delivered? Standardize engagement across the portfolio? Inform segmentation, role definitions, and service levelsEach goal level reflects a unique combination of where the client is today (maturity) and what they’re ready for (appetite). Together, these determine how the MSP should engage—stabilizing infrastructure or co-planning innovation.The Client Business Goal model provides a clear path from support and enablement toward modernization, transformation, and innovation, ensuring every CS motion is aligned with client readiness and strategic ambition.
The 5 Levels of Client Business Goals 1.1. Technology SupportFocus: Reliable, well-managed infrastructureClient Need: “Just keep things running.”At this level, clients have low maturity and low appetite. They rely on the MSP for stability, uptime, and issue resolution. Engagement is reactive and measured through SLAs, ticketing, and service quality.Typical Roles: Owner/Founder, Field Technician, Helpdesk1.2. Technology EnablementFocus: Stabilizing operations and delivering foundational projectsClient Need: “Help us manage IT better.”Clients begin adopting core tools and delivery structures. The MSP introduces onboarding playbooks, standard deliverables, and visible risk mitigation. Appetite grows, but maturity is still forming.Typical Roles: Service Delivery Manager, Technical Account Manager1.3. Technology Modernization (Where most MSPs operate today)Focus: Aligning IT environments to best practices and security standardsClient Need: “Ensure we’re up to date and secure.”Clients expect lifecycle planning, stack standardization, and structured cadence (QBRs, budgets, reports). Both maturity and appetite are developing. Strategic roles like vCIO begin to shape forward-looking planning.Typical Roles: Account Manager, vCIO1.4. Business TransformationFocus: Driving operational efficiency and strategic improvementClient Need: “Help us work smarter.”Clients have high maturity and an increasing appetite. The MSP supports process optimization, cross-departmental collaboration, and business-aligned initiatives. Technology becomes a means of measurable improvement.Typical Roles: Strategic Business Advisor, vCISO1.5. Business InnovationFocus: Enabling growth, differentiation, and strategic changeClient Need: “Help us grow and innovate.”Clients are high in both maturity and appetite. They treat technology as a driver of competitive advantage. The MSP co-plans strategic initiatives (e.g., AI, BI, transformation labs) with executive stakeholders. Services are tailored to departments and OKRs.Typical Roles: vCXO, SME Consultants (AI, BI, ISO, ERP)
?? 1. Technology Support
1. Technology Support Technology Support is the foundational Client Business Goal for MSPs, focused on delivering operational stability, visibility, and security in fragmented or reactive environments. Clients at this level are typically low maturity and low appetite, seeking to reduce risk, downtime, and support noise without yet engaging in strategic planning. This goal reflects a Low Impact / Low Engagement quadrant: the client wants IT to “just work” but is not yet investing in change.The MSP’s role is to stabilize the environment through monitoring, ticketing, reporting, and service delivery, driven by standard operating procedures (SOPs). This creates the first measurable proof of value and opens the door to future CS activities. By integrating basic elements of Health, Delivery, Process, People, and Strategy—even in minimal form—this level transforms firefighting into structured, trustworthy service that builds the foundation for growth, modernization, and future engagement.Strategic planning is minimal, but early segmentation and visibility practices can prepare the client for the next phase of enablement.OverviewWhat is the objective?Why is it important?As an MSP, why do I need to do this?What is the Customer impact?Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Technology Support Is the Entry Point to Strategic ValueConcept #2: Support-Centric Clients Require Confidence, Not ComplexityConcept #3: Technology Support Clients Can Be High Risk—If MisreadConcept #4: The Role of CS Is to Create Visibility, Not UrgencyConcept #5: This Stage Defines the CS Baseline—and the Roadmap to ProgressImplementation Process1.

OverviewWhat is the objective?To ensure clients have a reliable, well-managed, and visible IT infrastructure. The focus is on stabilization, visibility, and foundational readiness—helping clients reduce noise, resolve risks, and operate securely with minimal disruption.Why is it important?This is the foundation level of Customer Success:? Without operational stability, no strategic initiative can be sustained.? Enables trust, transparency, and early reporting habits.? Forming the first measurable proof of value between MSP and the client.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Positions the MSP as a trusted operator, not just a reactive provider? Makes performance visible and reportable? Opens the door for further CS initiatives once core systems are stable? Often enables a shift from firefighting to proactive task executionWhat is the Customer impact?At this stage, clients experience the MSP primarily as a reactive support function, rather than a strategic partner. They receive technical reliability, but little guidance or forward planning.? Impact: Low business impact – Services reduce operational noise (e.g., downtime, tickets) but don’t yet connect to outcomes like productivity, collaboration, or growth.Engagement: Low strategic engagement – Interactions are infrequent, typically issue-driven, and focused on support rather than planning or business value.Client mindset: “Just keep things running.”This quadrant—Low Impact / Low Engagement—is typical for:? New clients are in onboarding or rescue mode.? Long-time clients without strategic renewal.? Cost-sensitive clients who equate IT with utilities, rather than viewing it as a means of enablement.At this stage, even basic Discovery is often skipped, and strategic intake has yet to begin. These clients need early wins, not long decks.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Technology Support Is the Entry Point to Strategic ValueTechnology Support is where most MSP-client relationships begin. It is the foundation layer of the Client Business Goal model—the starting point for any strategic co-planning or roadmap work.Clients operating at this level often:? Expect a reactive or ticket-based service? Focus on stability, uptime, and basic infrastructure? View the MSP as a technical responder rather than a business partnerThis mode of engagement aligns closely with Segment D clients, characterized by low engagement and low impact. The client’s immediate need is reliable support, not transformation or enablement. For MSPs, the objective is not to force strategy too early, but to stabilize operations and build trust.Concept #2: Support-Centric Clients Require Confidence, Not ComplexityAt the Technology Support level, clients are often in a reactive posture:? They may have legacy systems, minimal internal IT expertise, or a limited appetite for change? Their KPIs revolve around uptime, issue resolution, and responsiveness? Strategic initiatives may be perceived as disruptive or prematureThe goal at this stage is to deliver a consistent service experience with:? Clear escalation paths and SLA alignment? Basic lifecycle visibility (e.g., hardware refresh reminders)? Lightweight, support-relevant assessments or reviewsThese clients don’t need a vCIO—they need service and field technicians who can translate issues into patterns, stabilize workflows, and introduce maturity concepts over time in a gentle manner. However, in most MSPs at this level, the Customer Success function is not absent—it is typically owned by the owner or founder, who acts as the de facto strategic leader (or pseudo-vice chief information officer, or VCIO).This means that, although there is no dedicated vCIO role, someone still needs to maintain a minimum CS rhythm—typically annually—encompassing Discovery, Assessment, Annual Meeting, Initiative creation, and early strategic guidance.Concept #3: Technology Support Clients Can Be High Risk—If MisreadWhile these clients appear stable, they often lack:? Documentation and process discipline? Visibility into asset lifecycle or risk exposure? Strategic planning habitsThis makes them high-risk for reactive churn. A service outage or poor ticket experience can undermine the entire relationship because there is no broader strategic context to mitigate its impact.That’s why Customer Success at this level should still include:? Simple Health Metrics: Are We Resolving? Are they responsive? Are we showing up regularly?? Lightweight Discovery: What has changed in the client’s business? Are there early signs of appetite?? Segment-aware cadence: Annual reviews may suffice—but only if they happen.The goal is not to over-serve or overwhelm, but to consistently execute the basics and prepare for eventual maturity.Concept #4: The Role of CS Is to Create Visibility, Not UrgencyIn Technology Support relationships, urgency must be earned. These clients often don’t yet see the value of assessments, budgets, or roadmaps. That’s okay. The role of Customer Success here is to observe and document:? Where are the gaps in alignment or readiness?? What risks are being tolerated?? What pain could be solved by scalable solutions?Initiatives, when introduced, should be small, tangible, and directly linked to pain reduction (e.g., reducing ticket volume, solving recurring issues, consolidating vendor sprawl). The first step toward strategic CS is earning the right to propose.Concept #5: This Stage Defines the CS Baseline—and the Roadmap to ProgressTechnology Support is not a failure—it’s a phase. It represents where many clients naturally begin. The key is to:? Recognize their position in the maturity/appetite matrix? Align delivery cadence and expectations accordingly? Establish a system of record for Health, Adoption, and Engagement signals—even if they're limitedThis creates the baseline from which the client can grow. When Health indicators begin to shift (e.g., increasing responsiveness, openness to lifecycle discussions), the MSP can propose a discovery-driven transition toward lifecycle services, basic initiatives, and eventually roadmap collaboration.In most cases, the owner or founder is responsible for executing this progression. They must manage the entire early CS cycle—from Discovery to Assessment to Annual Meeting and Initiative definition—alongside their other executive duties.Assessments are not mandatory at this stage, but recommended, especially when the MSP wants to make clear that an initiative idea stems from client-acknowledged needs, not just internal recommendations.This creates a bottleneck not on the client side, but on the MSP side: lack of time, structure, and delegation often means these tasks are delayed or skipped. As a result, clients don’t experience the visibility, education, and strategic impression necessary to build an appetite.At this level, only a few small, pain-reduction initiatives are likely to emerge, and they are typically operational (e.g., reduce ticket noise, replace outdated hardware).Technology Support isn’t a dead end—it’s the front door to strategic partnership, if navigated with patience, structure, and consistency. Recognizing that the bottleneck is often internal is crucial for designing more effective early-CS support structures.
Implementation Process1. Track Minimum Viable CS Health MetricsIntroduce lightweight, foundational CS Health tracking. These clients don’t require advanced analytics—but a consistent signal baseline helps stabilize operations and anticipate future engagement.? 2.1 Client Experience - Use NPS or CSAT from support tickets to gauge satisfaction. Feedback loops should be simple and tied to issue resolution quality.? 2.2 Engagement - Measure incident/ticket volumes and frequency of structured meetings (even if annual). Avoid misinterpreting high ticket noise as high engagement.? 2.3 Technology Adoption - Track only essential coverage: monitored backups, antivirus, patching, and basic M365 usage. Avoid deep adoption scoring at this stage.? 2.4 Service Quality - Use SLA compliance (response + resolution times) and first-call resolution rate. These provide key indicators of reliability and service consistency.? 2.5 Service Level Alignment - Verify whether support activity matches the defined scope. Are we doing work outside contracted services? Are patching or backup expectations aligned?2. Deliver Consistent, Foundational OutputsStandardize the minimum required deliverables that help shift the client from reactive firefighting to visible, reliable service:? 3.1 Reports - Focus on monthly or quarterly Ticket Summaries, Backup Status, and Asset Lifecycle Reports. Ensure these are shared in a consistent format, even without a dedicated meeting.? Blueprints 3.2–3.5 (Proposal, Budget, Strategy, Roadmap) are not recommended at this stage. They may be introduced later through 4.4 Meeting or 4.5 Initiatives if maturity improves.3. Execute a Minimal CS RhythmAvoid overwhelming the client with strategic motions. Instead, adopt a minimal, cadence-based structure that introduces process without requiring buy-in for full engagement:? 4.1 Scheduling/Trigger - Define one annual strategic meeting, triggered by contract anniversary or renewal cycle. Monthly reporting may be shared asynchronously. Even this minimal cadence forms the backbone of early Customer Success rhythm.? 4.2 Discovery Intake (Business Discovery) - Introduce a lightweight Discovery conversation prior to the annual meeting. This is not an in-depth consultation—it is designed to ask basic business-context questions (e.g., recent changes, growth concerns, pain points). It helps detect early appetite signals and clarifies whether future initiatives may emerge.? 4.3 Meeting - Hold an Annual Check-in Meeting, even if it remains tactical. Use it to:? Confirm support expectations? Review simple performance reports? Highlight low-effort improvements (e.g., backup gaps, asset lifecycle risks)? 4.4 Assessment Intake (optional) - Introduce only if appetite is evident. Use a basic intake to define recurring technical or operational challenges. Assessment formats should be lightweight and pain-driven.? 4.5 Initiatives Limit to 1–2 operational pain-reduction initiatives per year. These may include:? Reducing ticket noise? Streamlining recurring support workflows? Replacing unsupported or unreliable hardware Initiatives should be owned by the MSP, but based on observations surfaced during Discovery and the Annual Meeting.4. Assign Practical Roles and ResponsibilitiesAt this stage, there are no dedicated strategic roles. Roles must be scoped narrowly to maintain delivery discipline while preparing the MSP for scale:? 5.1 Roles & 5.2 Responsibilities -The Owner/Founder acts as the TAM/vCIO proxy, owning:? Discovery conversations? The Annual Check-in Meeting? Initiative proposal and scope communication To prevent growth bottlenecks, this must be treated as a repeatable annual leadership task, not an ad hoc engagement.? Helpdesk / Field Tech / NOC/SOC teams are responsible for:? Consistent ticket resolution? Backup and asset status tracking? Visibility reporting? These teams should aim for regular, structured updates, not only ad hoc interventions. Their observations often form the trigger points for Discovery and Initiative suggestions.? The Owner/Founder must carve out dedicated time each year to ensure this rhythm occurs. Without at least Discovery and Meeting once annually, clients may stagnate at this level indefinitely. This responsibility should be treated as a leadership discipline, not an afterthought.? 5.3 Enablement - Provide entry-level enablement on:? Identifying recurring technical pain patterns? Communicating asset or coverage gaps to the Owner for follow-up? 5.4 Compensation - Strategic contributions are not expected or rewarded at this level. Should be aligned with:? SLA adherence? First-response resolution? Consistent reporting activity? 5.5 Governance - No formal governance exists. However, the Owner/Founder should review CS Health signals quarterly to:? Track segment fit? Catch missed meetings or reports? Adjust initiative scope or cadence based on ticket or Discovery input5. Calibrate Strategy Inputs to Segment D StandardsAvoid over-engineering the strategic framework. Focus on consistency, visibility, and readiness assessment—not transformation.? 1.1 Segmentation - Tag these clients as Segment D. Use Low Touch engagement and a cost-driven investment model (1–2% MRR guideline). Do not force lifecycle initiatives.? 1.2 Engagement Strategy - Apply semi-annual or annual cadences, asynchronous updates, and no proposal cycles. Ownership resides with support staff and the Owner.? 1.3 CS Playbooks - Deploy a Segment D playbook that defines:? Report formats? Annual meeting flow? Minimum initiative definition criteria? 1.4 Roadmaps -  Not applicable at this level unless an initiative emerges organically from a support trend. No proactive roadmap construction.? 1.5 Standardization - Ensure all outputs (Ticket Reports, Asset Snapshots, Backup Summaries) follow standardized Segment D templates. This enables early benchmarking and trend analysis.
AppendixHow does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Customer Success Strategy - Strategic planning is minimal. Clients at this level may be grouped into Segment D (Low Touch) and represent a Cost Driver–style investment model, characterized by a 1% allocation of Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), although this is only an example and not a fixed rule.? 2. Customer Success Health - At this stage, CS Health focuses on operational indicators, including SLA compliance, ticket trends, backup status, and CSAT. These metrics help MSPs monitor identity, surface recurring issues, and track growth in readiness and further maturity.? 3. Customer Success Delivery - Delivery is centred on operational reports and visibility tools, such as asset inventories, ticket summaries, and technology health assessments. These deliverables validate that core IT services are being delivered consistently and effectively.? 4. Customer Success Process - Processes are largely reactive or maintenance-driven. Typical triggers include incidents, renewals, or policy checks. Execution follows standard operating procedures (SOPs) for backup verification, patching, and incident reporting, ensuring baseline performance.? 6. Customer Success Team - Primary roles include Owner/Founder acting as Technical Account Manager (TAM), Helpdesk Support, Service/Field Technicians, and Security Operations Center (SOC)/Network Operations Center (NOC) staff. These roles are responsible for maintaining stability, monitoring systems, and reporting issues; no dedicated strategic roles have been engaged yet.Product Links / Tooling Support?

Devices are out of warranty or beyond their lifecycle. Documentation is limited or offline. Backup is manual or unmonitored.

?? 2. Technology Enablement
2. Technology Enablement Technology Enablement is the first Client Business Goal where the MSP transitions from reactive support to proactive service delivery. Clients at this level typically exhibit low to medium maturity and a low appetite—their environments are partially aligned, but they’re not yet seeking full-scale change. This places them in a Low Business Impact / Medium–High Engagement quadrant: the client wants IT to “just work,” and is increasingly engaged in structured delivery, but not yet ready for strategic planning.The MSP’s role is to standardize and align services, reduce friction, and deliver structured projects, such as BCDR, stack alignment, or onboarding improvements. Planning begins to formalize—discovery, assessment, and cadence emerge—but most engagement remains operational. Done well, this stage creates the conditions for future modernization by building repeatable success, clear documentation, and increasing trust in the MSP’s structured delivery.OverviewWhat is the objective?Why is it important?As an MSP, why do I need to do this?What is the Customer impact?Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Technology Enablement Is the First Step Toward Outcome-Focused ServiceConcept #2: Enablement Priorities Are Practical, Not StrategicConcept #3: Technology Enablement Is the Launch Point for Initiative-Based EngagementConcept #4: Enablement-Level Clients Need CS Structure, Not ComplexityConcept #5: Technology Enablement Matures the Relationship and Prepares for Strategic PlanningImplementation Process1.

Prepare for Transition to ModernizationAppendixHow does it connect to the other parts?Product Links / Tooling SupportBest Practice IndicatorsExample Client Profile
OverviewWhat is the objective?To help clients better manage IT operations by aligning the tech stack, improving service quality, and delivering structured projects. The focus is on enabling productivity through stable, integrated tools and processes, supported by proactive MSP involvement.Why is it important?? Lays the groundwork for scalable, supportable IT environments? Moves the client from reactive firefighting toward structured service delivery? Enables deeper reporting, more consistent outcomes, and improved tech adoption? Sets the stage for modernization, automation, and long-term planningAs an MSP, why do I need to do this?The MSP evolves from ad-hoc support to structured service delivery. This includes delivering planned projects, aligning service execution with a standardized tech stack, and eliminating chaos through process and platform consistency.A dedicated TAM or Service Delivery Manager replaces the Owner/Founder as the Customer Success lead, removing key-person risk and introducing coordinated delivery across Helpdesk, Projects, and Account Management.However, while these roles are dedicated, they often bring a strong technical foundation but lack strategic and business orientation. As a result, Discovery and Assessment conversations at this stage tend to focus on systems and infrastructure rather than the client’s business context, goals, or appetite for transformation. This limits the MSP’s ability to elevate the conversation and ignite strategic engagement.To address this, TAMs and SDMs must be supported with playbooks, question sets, and coaching that introduce business-centric framing—even in operational conversations. Appetite is not unlocked through tools alone—it grows when clients feel their business is understood.From a segmentation perspective, these clients are typically in Segment C. Their maturity is increasing, often signalled by a decline in firefighting and improved service consistency. However, their appetite remains low: they are responsive to recommendations but rarely initiate requests or ask forward-looking questions. Instead, they’re engaging just enough to approve fixes and appreciate reliability.This is why strategic CS cadence is so important: the Bi-Annual Strategic Meeting, preceded by structured Discovery and optionally by an Assessment, gives the client a lens into their progress—and creates space to reframe operational wins into business value.The MSP evolves from ad-hoc support to structured service delivery. This includes delivering planned projects, aligning service execution with a standardized tech stack, and eliminating chaos through process and platform consistency.What is the Customer impact?Clients begin to experience more structured and predictable service. IT becomes less of a distraction and more of a utility: tickets decline, recurring issues are resolved, and confidence builds.They appreciate that “someone is finally managing IT”—but they aren’t yet leaning in. Their engagement is reactive: they approve projects, attend reviews occasionally, and respond to issues, but they rarely initiate change or ask strategic questions.The value they see is technology-first: stability, fewer surprises, and better documentation. Conversations are still focused on operational improvements, rather than long-term outcomes.Early discovery or assessment discussions may begin, but typically remain shallow or MSP-led, focusing on stack gaps, service hygiene, or tool adoption.These clients live in the Low Business Impact / Medium–High Engagement quadrant. They show up, they appreciate structure, but they haven’t yet connected IT to business enablement or transformation.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Technology Enablement Is the First Step Toward Outcome-Focused ServiceClients at the Technology Enablement stage have moved past a purely reactive mindset. They no longer define value only by ticket resolution or uptime. Instead, they begin to ask:? Are our tools being used effectively?? Can we mitigate recurring issues by optimizing the configuration?? What should we standardize or automate?This stage reflects a shift from Service Consumption to Service Utilization. Clients are often still operational, but they are ready to address recurring friction, stabilize their stack, and optimize for internal efficiency.These clients typically fall into Segment C or early Segment B, showing signs of engagement and growth potential, but are still limited by budget, mindset, or technical maturity.Concept #2: Enablement Priorities Are Practical, Not StrategicTechnology Enablement isn’t about innovation—it’s about getting the current tools to work better for the client’s business context. Typical priorities include:? Increasing adoption of existing platforms (e.g., Teams, SharePoint, RMM tools)? Improving onboarding and access management processes? Streamlining ticket handling through automation or training? Reducing alert fatigue or recurring issues through root cause initiativesAt this level, clients don’t need a roadmap—they need lightweight assessments, tailored guidance, and help identifying clear wins from their existing stack. Success looks like:? Fewer repeat tickets? Better end-user satisfaction? Clear internal owners for IT-dependent workflowsConcept #3: Technology Enablement Is the Launch Point for Initiative-Based EngagementEnablement opens the door to proactive planning—not by forcing big strategies, but by creating space for small, scoped, and meaningful initiatives. Examples include:? A backup validation process? MFA deployment for remaining users? A printer standardization or refresh planThese initiatives begin to introduce structure:? They are discussed and approved in light cadence (Segment-aware QBRs or Lifecycle Reviews)? They may lead to formal proposals or budget items? They start to link technical actions to business benefits (e.g., reduced downtime, improved onboarding)In this way, Enablement becomes the first proving ground for the MSP’s strategic credibility.Concept #4: Enablement-Level Clients Need CS Structure, Not ComplexityAt this stage, clients still value simplicity. They may resist long meetings, layered roadmaps, or multi-step scoring models. That’s why the CS Process must be:? Cadence-aware, but lightweight? Outcome-focused, not tool-driven? Enabled with templates that clarify next steps, not overwhelmThe MSP’s job is to:? Make adoption and alignment visible (via clear Discovery + Assessment)? Recommend manageable actions (1–3 key initiatives at a time)? Track and follow up through Governance and CS HealthThis builds client confidence and sets the stage for broader conversations in future quarters.Even with a formal cadence, many Enablement-stage clients will not voice business needs unless prompted. That’s why Assessments, while optional, are strongly recommended—they help shift ownership of initiatives toward the client by showing that improvement areas were identified collaboratively. Without this, most initiatives tend to feel MSP-driven, thereby reducing their strategic weight.To succeed, Discovery and Assessment should include business-context questions, not just technical gaps. This shift enables clients to articulate their goals, connect IT to outcomes, and transition from a consumption-based approach to one that fosters collaboration.Concept #5: Technology Enablement Matures the Relationship and Prepares for Strategic PlanningClients in the Enablement stage are not yet strategic co-planners, but they’re no longer passive consumers. They are emerging collaborators, and the MSP’s role is to:? Recognize their readiness? Deliver structured wins? Use those wins to justify the next level of partnershipClient maturity at this stage is not just about reduced tickets—it’s about operational readiness to adopt strategic building blocks. Readiness signals include:? No fires present—daily operations are stable? Openness to Stack Alignment investments? Willingness to implement foundational security (identity, endpoint, threat protection)? Interest in up-to-date hardware and cloud migration? Adoption of modern backup/resiliency solutions? Support for remote work, enablement, and collaboration? Progress on cyber risk management and insurability pathwaysWhen these indicators are present, the MSP can shift from operational alignment to long-term enablement, with cadence, structure, and business context framing as the bridge.
Implementation Process1. Define Segment and Cadence ExpectationsClients at the Technology Enablement level typically fall into Segment C: Mid-Touch. They require structured delivery but limited strategic depth. Cadence should be standardized to:? Monthly reporting (automated or shared via structured reports)? Quarterly service reviews? Bi-Annual Strategic Meeting with optional Assessment supportUse 1.1 Segmentation and 1.2 Engagement Strategy to:? Confirm this client is a match for Segment C? Establish a minimum engagement rhythm? Assign ownership to the Service Delivery Manager (SDM) or Technical Account Manager (TAM)2. Track and Align Customer Success Health SignalsEnablement-stage clients must show signs of increasing maturity and operational alignment. CS Health focus areas include:? 2.2 Engagement: Are clients attending meetings, responding to follow-ups, and engaging in reviews?? 2.3 Technology Adoption: Are key tools deployed and in use (e.g., Teams, BCDR tools, M365)?? 2.4 Service Quality: Is SLA adherence consistent? Are repeat issues being reduced?? 2.5 Service Level Alignment: Are we delivering the right services at the right frequency?These indicators guide the MSP’s assessment of whether Enablement is successful or whether adjustments are needed.3. Execute Cadence-Based CS Process? 4.1 Scheduling/Trigger: Use contract milestones or quarterly intervals to schedule structured check-ins and project planning reviews.? 4.2 Discovery Intake: Begin asking business-context questions that reveal appetite, friction points, and department-specific pain (not just stack alignment).? 4.3 Assessment Intake: Optional but recommended—especially for larger clients or those showing signs of increased initiative engagement. Helps surface and justify initiatives.? 4.4 Meeting: Quarterly reviews should now include simple project outcomes, stack alignment scores, and adoption metrics. Begin to surface initiative opportunities for planning.? 4.5 Initiatives: Document 2–3 tangible initiatives per quarter. Focus on hygiene, compliance, or risk mitigation. Position them in light cadence reviews and summarize with proposals or budgets.4. Assign Roles and Enablement? 5.1 Roles:? SDM becomes the primary delivery coordinator? TAM manages discovery and initiative documentation? Technical leads and support staff execute projects and resolve escalations? 5.2 Responsibilities:? SDMs own meeting execution and cadence? TAMs own initiative framing and communication? Project team members execute scoped work? 5.3 Enablement:? Provide templates for project tracking, Discovery formats, and initiative briefs? Train SDMs and TAMs on asking business-aligned questions, not just technical ones? 5.4 Compensation:? Link to ticket reduction, project delivery rates, and CS Health metrics (Engagement & Quality)? 5.5 Governance:? Informal but recurring—monthly CS Health review, quarterly delivery check-ins by leadership5. Use Strategy as a Framing ToolEnablement is where CS Strategy starts to take root. Use:? 1.3 Playbooks to guide how projects are selected, executed, and reported? 1.4 Roadmaps to lightly structure project timelines for discussion, even if they are not yet full strategic plans? 1.5 Standardization to ensure the same Discovery questions, Assessment formats, and initiative templates are used across Enablement clientsThis discipline-level integration ensures that MSP delivery is predictable, scalable, and increasingly tied to outcomes, even if strategic planning remains limited.6. Prepare for Transition to ModernizationBy the end of Enablement:? Fires should be rare? The stack should be aligned or in progress? Clients should begin initiating small changes or asking, "What's next?"When these signs emerge, use Discovery + Assessment + Bi-Annual Meeting to re-segment the client and recommend transitioning to Technology Modernization. Align this transition with CS Health indicators and initiative success metrics to ensure readiness.
AppendixHow does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Customer Success Strategy - Clients typically fall into Segment C – Mid-Touch. They receive standardized but recurring engagements and are on the path toward modernization and strategic planning.? 2. Customer Success Health - Focus shifts to Service Quality and Service Quantity. Metrics include project delivery status, SLA consistency, incident frequency, ticket closure rate, and service coverage across the aligned stack.? 3. Customer Success Delivery - Key deliverables include stack alignment reports, infrastructure budgets, ticket trend summaries, backup and disaster recovery (DR) alignment reports, and related operational outputs. Project proposals and Statements of Work (SOWs) begin to take shape.? 4. Customer Success Process - Recurring engagement rhythms (monthly or quarterly) drive service reviews. Structured intake begins through discovery and assessments, and the first formalized initiatives emerge through project-level engagement and SOP execution.? 6. Customer Success People - Typical roles include the Service Delivery Manager, who serves as the quarterback, supported by Technical Account Managers. These team members are responsible for planning, implementing, and reporting on operational projects. Strategic advisors (vCIO/vCTO) may still be absent at this stage.Product Links / Tooling SupportLMx Client Health can help track:? Service activity quantity and coverage?

There is no strategic lead on the client side—an office manager or an overwhelmed team member may be the point of contact.They want IT to be stable, predictable, and less frustrating—but they’re not thinking long-term. There is little executive involvement, and a limited vision beyond “making things work better.”Maturity is low to medium: some progress, but still vulnerable to inconsistency. Appetite is low: clients are receptive to improvements but don’t initiate them.The MSP drives the relationship, delivering visible value through standardization and structured projects. The foundation is being laid for modernization, but business transformation still feels like a distant step.
?? 3. Technology Modernization
3. Technology ModernizationTechnology Modernization is where MSP-client relationships begin to evolve from structured delivery into structured transformation. At this level, clients show readiness to modernize their stack, adopt cloud-first platforms, and embrace lifecycle-driven decisions. The MSP shifts from firefighting and tactical delivery to roadmap-driven execution. Engagement becomes more strategic, but is still primarily technology-focused. Strategic planning is introduced, and clients begin to co-own the decision-making process. This phase sets the foundation for cross-functional impact and long-term business alignment.OverviewWhat is the objective?Why is it important?As an MSP, why do I need to do this?What is the Customer impact?Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Technology Modernization Marks the Transition from Reactive Fixes to Lifecycle PlanningConcept #2: Modernization Requires Cross-Role Orchestration and Process MaturityConcept #3: Modernization Relies on Clear Scoring, Prioritization, and Proposal StrategyConcept #4: Modernization Prepares Clients for Strategic Enablement—If Managed ProperlyConcept #5: Modernization Clients Require Segment-Calibrated Support and Strategic FramingImplementation Process1.

OverviewWhat is the objective?To guide clients through structured modernization of their IT environment—including cloud adoption, stack consolidation, and platform lifecycle upgrades—while building repeatable planning, budgeting, and execution rhythms. This phase marks the transition from “running IT” to intentionally transforming it.Why is it important?Technology Modernization marks the shift from structured delivery to structured transformation. Clients at this stage aren’t yet driving innovation, but they are leaning into structured improvement. They’re investing in stack alignment, security, and lifecycle upgrades, and they’re becoming more open to planning.This unlocks:? Better risk control through lifecycle and security planning? More efficient operations via consolidation and modernization? Higher platform adoption and internal enablement? Early strategic engagement through roadmaps and budget planningFrom an MSP perspective, this phase introduces scalable rhythms—like discovery  ? assessment (typically recommended, but not mandatory) ? roadmap ? proposal ? execution—even when full executive appetite is not yet present.These clients often live in the “Moderate and growing Business Impact / High Engagement” quadrant. They’re not driving top-down innovation, but they’re attending meetings, responding to proposals, and implementing the plan.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Strategic value is primarily framed around technology maturity and operational improvement: infrastructure health, cloud adoption, SaaS utilization, and lifecycle upgrades.? Clients are typically in Segment B—characterized by Moderate and growing maturity, as well as high appetite.? This is the stage where dedicated Account Managers and vCIOs are actively engaged. QBRs (Quarterly Business Reviews) and monthly tactical meetings are in place, providing rhythm and accountability.? These process elements and strategy mechanisms (1.2 Engagement Strategy, 1.3 Playbooks) work in concert to deliver planned value.What is the Customer impact?? Clients feel they’re gaining control, with fewer outages, increased stability, and clearer plans.? They begin to think in quarters, not just fire drills. This is often the first time they’re co-owning roadmap reviews or budget planning.? Business leadership may remain at arm’s length, but operational stakeholders are engaged and responsive.? Value is still primarily driven by technology, with improvements in availability, standardization, or security.? These clients care deeply about being modern, compliant, and efficient, but they require ongoing coaching to connect IT to business outcomes effectively.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Technology Modernization Marks the Transition from Reactive Fixes to Lifecycle PlanningAt the Modernization stage, clients are no longer just trying to make existing tools work—they are ready to replace, consolidate, or restructure their technology environment in service of long-term business outcomes.These clients are:? Replacing outdated infrastructure or unsupported platforms? Standardizing tools across locations or departments? Seeking to reduce complexity, cost, or operational risk? Asking questions like: “What should we be using instead of this?” or “How can we future-proof our setup?”This posture reflects a shift into Segment B behaviour: appetite is high, maturity is moderate, and clients seek strategic clarity, not just execution support. Clients at this stage are Ready for Modernization and Technology Adoption, including:? Stack Alignment Parity achieved? Unified Communications Strategy improvements? Deeper Remote Work and Collaboration enablement? Roadmapping and Goal Setting practices? Cloud Adoption Readiness or in progress? Security Foundations in place? Data Loss Prevention (DLP) strategies under consideration? Asset Lifecycle Management program implemented? vCTO-level guidance readinessConcept #2: Modernization Requires Cross-Role Orchestration and Process MaturityTechnology Modernization isn’t one project—it’s a coordinated initiative layer, often spanning multiple proposals, timelines, and departments. To succeed, it requires:? TAMs to identify recurring technical or lifecycle triggers (e.g. aging assets, ticket patterns)? vCIOs to structure modernization into initiative groups and link them to roadmap planning? CSMs or AMs to manage pacing, client readiness, and stakeholder alignmentAt this level, Customer Success Health depends on coordinated execution:? Is Adoption improving as systems are replaced?? Is Engagement sustained through longer delivery timelines?? Are Service Quality and Alignment scores holding up through change?Modernization exposes all weak points in your CS system—unless well-enabled and governed.Concept #3: Modernization Relies on Clear Scoring, Prioritization, and Proposal StrategyModernization is typically triggered by a recommended—but not mandatory assessment that reveals risk, fragmentation, or inefficiency. These findings should be:? Translated into scored initiatives, using compliance or readiness indicators? Prioritized using segmentation logic and business context? Framed within a Proposal–Roadmap–Budget planning cycleFor example:? A client may receive a Lifecycle Assessment showing that 70% of endpoints are end-of-life and scattered across platforms? The MSP scores the modernization impact and proposes a two-phase refresh, with aligned budgets and milestones? Over the next 6–12 months, the initiative is tracked via Governance checkpoints and validated via CS Health metricsThis structure ensures that modernization is not just a reactive clean-up—it’s a planned, measured transformation.Concept #4: Modernization Prepares Clients for Strategic Enablement—If Managed ProperlyWhile modernization work is technical, its success depends on:? Consistent meeting cadence to manage transitions and approvals? Visible initiative tracking with outcomes linked to business goals? Alignment between delivery rhythm and client readinessIf rushed or poorly communicated, modernization can overwhelm clients. If well-managed, it becomes a strategic trust accelerator that prepares the client for higher-value engagements, such as lifecycle planning, playbook adoption (7.3), and goal alignment frameworks (e.g., OKRs).This prepares the transition to a process-led QBR cadence (4.4) and full CS Strategy orchestration (1.1–1.3).Done right, modernization clears the runway for the next stage of CS maturity.Concept #5: Modernization Clients Require Segment-Calibrated Support and Strategic FramingClients in this stage may still feel Segment B (high impact, low engagement)—meaning they have real needs, but inconsistent executive attention or planning discipline. CS leaders must:? Use Enablement to coach internal teams on modernization messaging and pacing? Use Engagement Strategy to manage stakeholder drift and maintain rhythm? Use Governance to monitor initiative follow-through and update Health scores accordinglyThe CS job is to frame modernization not just as “cleanup,” but as a transformation layer—one that sets the stage for business enablement, cross-functional planning, and innovation.Modernization is the bridge between operational efficiency and strategic partnership. If supported by structure, cadence, and transparency, it becomes the most compelling justification for transitioning the client into complete lifecycle management.
Implementation Process1. Confirm Segment and Strategic Rhythm (1.1 Segmentation, 1.2 Engagement Strategy)Clients at the Modernization level are typically Segment B: high appetite, moderate and rising maturity. These clients are open to structured transformation but still require guidance on prioritization and planning. Confirm:? Engagement strategy includes Quarterly Strategic Roadmap Reviews and Monthly Tactical Meetings? Segment B cadence is mapped to a proactive AM/vCIO rhythm with role clarity and cadence accountability2. Operationalize CS Health Signals (2.x Customer Success Health)Technology Modernization requires elevated CS Health tracking:? 2.1 Client Experience (CX): Use feedback from project delivery and strategic reviews? 2.2 Engagement: Track initiative participation, roadmap sessions, and QBR attendance? 2.3 Technology Adoption: Use assessments to score stack alignment, lifecycle status, and SaaS utilization? 2.4 Service Quality: Validate execution quality through SLA metrics, issue reduction, and governance inputs? 2.5 Service Level Alignment: Ensure platform rollout and initiative execution match roadmap scope and CS Playbook guidelines3. Implement Structured CS Process (4.x Customer Success Process)? 4.1 Scheduling/Trigger: Define a repeatable planning rhythm linked to quarterly reviews and initiative cycles? 4.2 Discovery Intake: Conduct structured Discovery every 6–12 months to assess readiness, departmental needs, and risk posture? 4.3 Assessment Intake: Run modernization-focused assessments to reveal technical debt, lifecycle gaps, or misalignments? 4.4 Meeting: QBRs evolve to roadmap-oriented reviews with initiative scoring, client readiness validation, and proposal follow-up? 4.5 Initiatives: Structure all modernization efforts (e.g., BCDR, remote work enablement, DLP) into roadmap-synchronized initiative cards; group initiatives thematically for visibility and scoring4. Execute Modernization-Aligned CS Delivery (3.x Customer Success Delivery)? 3.1 Reports: Provide roadmap and initiative status, ticket patterns, SaaS usage summaries? 3.2 Proposal: All initiatives must link to a Proposal with defined outcomes and investment scope? 3.3 Budget: Consolidate project costs into structured budgets with client sign-off? 3.4 Strategy: Document initiative prioritization in a strategic framework; publish in client-facing format if appetite supports it? 3.5 Roadmap: Maintain an evolving, living roadmap tied to initiative outcomes, review cadence, and health progression5. Assign Roles and Strategic Responsibilities (5.x People Discipline)? 5.1 Roles:? vCIO: Initiative framing, roadmap management? AM: Cadence execution, stakeholder coordination? PM: Project delivery, milestone tracking? 5.2 Responsibilities:? AM owns the operational cycle (meetings, feedback)? vCIO drives roadmap and modernization design? 5.3 Enablement: Train all roles on initiative tracking, roadmap navigation, and lifecycle-based proposals? 5.4 Compensation: Tie incentives to roadmap completion rates, health improvement metrics, and client initiative success? 5.5 Governance: Conduct quarterly governance reviews of initiative execution, cadence consistency, and roadmap progress6. Frame Modernization with Strategy Integration (1.3–1.5 Strategy Discipline)? 1.3 Playbooks: Standardize initiative types by segment (e.g., SaaS adoption, cloud migration, endpoint refresh)? 1.4 Roadmaps: Establish client-visible roadmaps with milestones tied to assessments and budget alignment? 1.5 Standardization: Ensure initiative scoring, proposals, and roadmap visuals follow consistent formats for comparability and internal reportingModernization is the moment where structure becomes scalable. Done well, this implementation process creates alignment, earns trust, and prepares both MSP and client for the transition to Business Transformation.

They have introduced roadmaps, and IT champions are responsive and motivated; however, strategic conversations are still primarily focused on technology enablement, rather than business change.The MSP handles roadmap and budget planning, with growing client input. Some departments may begin requesting specific outcomes (e.g., faster onboarding or collaboration improvements), but these are still framed in technical language. Leadership is aware of the MSP’s value but delegates the relationship to operational owners.This client sits squarely in the “Moderate and growing Business Impact / High Engagement” quadrant. Their maturity is moderate but increasing, and their appetite is high. They’re starting to view MSPs as strategic, not just for infrastructure, but as structured partners for long-term success.
?? 4. Business Transformation
4. Business TransformationBusiness Transformation is the stage where MSPs partner with clients to drive measurable improvements in business operations, not just IT. These clients fall into Segment A, characterized by high maturity and high appetite, placing them in the High Impact / High Engagement quadrant.However, unlike Business Innovation clients, who fully co-lead innovation, Transformation clients are in a state of transition—strategically engaged but still guided externally. Technology now significantly influences business outcomes, including productivity, data strategy, and department-level performance. The MSP becomes a cross-functional planning partner, leading operational transformation initiatives with visibility into key metrics and delivering long-term value. A strategic rhythm is established, but full co-ownership of innovation remains to be achieved.OverviewWhat is the objective?Why is it important?As an MSP, why do I need to do this?What is the Customer impact?Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Business Transformation Begins When Technology Serves StrategyConcept #2: Business Transformation Requires Executive Language and Outcome MappingConcept #3: Transformation Depends on Strategic Rhythm and Internal GovernanceConcept #4: Health Metrics Must Reflect Transformation ComplexityConcept #5: Transformation Is the Catalyst for Expanding the MSP’s RoleImplementation Process1.

OverviewWhat is the objective?To support clients in the strategic use of technology to transform business operations. The focus is on enabling productivity, operational intelligence, and data-driven planning, utilizing technology to enhance the business's day-to-day operations.Why is it important?? Represents the transition from IT enablement to actual business process impact.? Technology is no longer just supporting users—it’s shaping how businesses operate.? Allows the MSP to drive higher-value initiatives tied to outcomes like efficiency, satisfaction, and expansion.? Enables data-backed decision-making on AI readiness, productivity, and transformation planning.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? MSP becomes a cross-functional advisor, helping departments align their workflows, tools, and goals through technology.? Leads initiatives like collaboration redesign, process automation, and AI readiness planning—connecting business priorities with execution.? Gains access to department leaders (Ops, HR, Finance), expanding influence beyond IT.? Plays a visible role in project success, contract renewals, and service expansion.? A strategic cadence is now expected, featuring annual planning with quarterly business reviews.? However, the MSP still owns most of the strategic framing—the client is engaged but not yet a co-leader of innovation.? This level is often observed in Segment A, where clients are transformation-minded but still rely on the MSP for planning leadership.What is the Customer impact?? Begins leveraging technology to improve how the business operates—shifting from IT support to IT-enabled transformation across departments.? Actively participates in planning cycles with the MSP, bringing business goals, pain points, and internal challenges to the table.? Gains measurable business outcomes through improved productivity, workflow efficiency, data visibility, and digital adoption.? Feels supported in executing cross-functional initiatives, such as collaboration upgrades, AI readiness, data governance, and workforce enablement.? Trusts the MSP as a strategic advisor, not just a delivery partner, especially as the MSP helps connect departmental needs with practical solutions.? Clients at this stage are no longer passive consumers. They are strategic partners, but innovation ownership is now shared. The MSP no longer drives everything, but co-leads: facilitating, pacing, and translating business priorities into execution frameworks. This shared leadership model is the hallmark of Business Transformation. Business Innovation, by contrast, is where innovation is client-led, and MSPs enable it.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Business Transformation Begins When Technology Serves StrategyAt the Business Transformation stage, the client’s focus shifts from IT outcomes to business outcomes powered by IT. This means:? Technology decisions are made to support business goals, not just lifecycle or risk remediation? Strategic initiatives are co-developed and co-owned with the MSP? The client begins to expect business justification, executive alignment, and post-project ROI reviewsThis stage is common for Segment A clients—those with high engagement and high impact. They are willing to plan proactively, participate in roadmap reviews, and allocate budget toward outcome-based initiatives. However, they also demand credibility, coordination, and clarity across every CS touchpoint.Concept #2: Business Transformation Requires Executive Language and Outcome MappingTo operate at this level, MSPs must shift from technical conversation to strategic framing. This means:? Proposals reference KPIs, or business impact, not just platforms and costs.? Initiatives are linked to department goals (e.g., “reduce onboarding time,” “enable hybrid work,” “decrease downtime costs”).? Assessments, Reports, and Budgets must speak in terms of enablement and return, not just infrastructure readiness.The vCIO becomes a strategic facilitator, not just a roadmap presenter—TAMs surface opportunity signals. CS Leaders coordinate messaging, sequencing, and follow-through across functions.This isn’t about selling more services—it’s about helping the client operationalize change.Concept #3: Transformation Depends on Strategic Rhythm and Internal GovernanceClients at this level want to move fast, but not chaotically. They expect structure:? A quarterly rhythm of Discovery ? Assessment ? Roadmap Review ? Budget Planning? Documented initiatives with impact summaries, timelines, and aligned roles? Initiative tracking and performance feedback are built into cadence meetingsTo deliver this, MSPs must rely on:? Governance to monitor initiative delivery, stakeholder engagement, and quality signals? Enablement to ensure every role, especially vCIOs and CS Managers, can lead transformation-level conversations? Standardization to support scalable templates and initiative frameworks that align with business goalsTransformation clients will disengage if the CS process is inconsistent or under-coordinated. Strategic rhythm is not optional at this level—it is the delivery model. The cadence at this level must reflect strategic complexity. This includes an Annual Year-End Review to align long-term business goals, Monthly Strategic Meetings to manage initiatives, and Bi-weekly Tactical Check-ins for operational follow-through. This rhythm ensures continuous visibility, proactive coordination, and stakeholder accountability, especially as transformation initiatives span departments and timelines.Concept #4: Health Metrics Must Reflect Transformation ComplexityCustomer Success Health becomes more nuanced at this level:? Engagement must reflect strategic participation, not just presence? Technology Adoption must track enablement impact, not deployment status? Service Alignment must evolve from lifecycle fit to business goal alignmentBusiness Transformation also requires longer initiative cycles, so Health scoring and Governance must account for that:? Proposals may span multiple quarters? ROI may appear post-delivery? Success may depend on client-side follow-throughMSPs must ensure CS Health reviews include initiative pacing, stakeholder context, and transformation trendlines—not just binary progress metrics.Concept #5: Transformation Is the Catalyst for Expanding the MSP’s RoleAt this stage, the client no longer views the MSP as a service vendor but as a co-architect of business evolution. This unlocks:? Cross-departmental engagement (e.g., working with finance, HR, operations)? Executive sponsorship and joint planning? Multi-year roadmaps tied to annual plansBut it also raises expectations:? Every CS meeting must be purposeful and well-prepared? Misalignment between what’s promised and what’s delivered damages trust quickly? The MSP must demonstrate business fluency, strategic responsiveness, and delivery reliabilityBusiness Transformation is not about scope—it’s about strategic presence. When CS execution and Health scoring reinforce that presence, the MSP becomes indispensable.
Implementation Process1. Confirm Segment and Strategic Cadence (1.1 Segmentation, 1.2 Engagement Strategy)Business Transformation clients belong to Segment A and operate within a High Impact / High Engagement quadrant. They require a mature cadence model, including:? Annual Strategic Planning? Quarterly Business Reviews? Monthly Strategic Meetings? Bi-Weekly Tactical Check-insEnsure these rhythms are mapped and owned by CS leadership (Strategic Business Advisor, CS Manager). These rhythms enable the structured momentum necessary for cross-departmental transformation.2. Expand and Calibrate CS Health Monitoring (2.x Customer Success Health)Transformation-level Health must evolve to track business impact:? 2.1 Client Experience (CX): Monitor outcome satisfaction, meeting participation, and strategic alignment? 2.2 Engagement: Track attendance and interaction across executive and departmental meetings? 2.3 Technology Adoption: Focus on productivity gains, advanced platform use, and workflow enablement? 2.4 Service Quality: Use feedback tied to strategic initiative outcomes (not just incident closure)? 2.5 Service Level Alignment: Ensure delivery cadence and initiative scope are tailored to department goalsCS Health reviews must account for pacing, stakeholder change, and initiative progress over multiple quarters.3. Execute Strategic Process Rhythm (4.x Customer Success Process)? 4.1 Scheduling/Trigger: Define annual and quarterly strategy checkpoints linked to budgeting, roadmap pivots, and transformation indicators? 4.2 Discovery Intake: Use business-focused discovery formats to surface department-level goals, productivity challenges, and change opportunities? 4.3 Assessment Intake: Mandatory at this level. Assessments should scope initiative complexity, readiness, and impact areas? 4.4 Meeting: Run strategy-focused QBRs with initiative summaries, roadmap updates, and cross-functional planning feedback? 4.5 Initiatives: Track all initiatives in a centralized portfolio. Score each initiative by segment-fit, strategic impact, and execution status. Include executive visibility and budgeting context.4. Deliver Outcome-Linked CS Outputs (3.x Customer Success Delivery)? 3.1 Reports: Must include trend analyses (tickets, projects), digital adoption dashboards, and strategic activity summaries? 3.2 Proposal: Each initiative must include proposal framing around ROI, department alignment, and enablement outcome? 3.3 Budget: Develop budgets that reflect multi-phase planning, outcome timing, and department-specific investment justification? 3.4 Strategy: Translate all technology planning into a business strategy context. Output must be executive-facing and reviewed quarterly? 3.5 Roadmap: Drive every QBR from a dynamic roadmap with initiative statuses, pacing indicators, and department-level dependencies5. Align Strategic CS Roles and Governance (5.x Customer Success People)? 5.1 Roles:? Strategic Business Advisor: Owns transformation framing, roadmap evolution, and cross-functional alignment? vCISO: Oversees compliance-driven initiatives and operational risk? CS Manager: Drives rhythm execution, initiative pacing, and stakeholder accountability? 5.2 Responsibilities:? Advisors and Managers co-lead roadmap discussions with client executives and department leads? vCISO ensures security- and data-governance-aligned projects are scoped and tracked? 5.3 Enablement:? Train CS roles on multi-stakeholder engagement, KPI mapping, and transformation storytelling? 5.4 Compensation:? Tie to strategic meeting delivery, initiative outcomes, and roadmap execution accuracy? 5.5 Governance:? Implement a quarterly governance review focused on:? Initiative success rate? Strategic alignment of proposed activities? Health score changes linked to business indicators6. Reinforce Strategy as a Transformation Catalyst (1.3–1.5 CS Strategy)? 1.3 Playbooks: Use transformation-specific playbooks to map common initiative types (AI readiness, collaboration redesign, process automation)? 1.4 Roadmaps: Roadmaps must integrate milestones, dependency mapping, and outcome timelines? 1.5 Standardization: Standardize all initiative briefs, business reports, and cadence structures across Segment A to ensure clarity, scalability, and CS Health comparabilityBusiness Transformation is the phase where operational cadence and business framing converge. This implementation process ensures that the MSP remains the strategic driver while helping the client grow into shared innovation leadership.

Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Business Innovation Begins When the MSP Becomes a Strategic Growth PartnerAt the Business Innovation level, clients don’t just seek IT support or transformation—they expect the MSP to contribute to their long-term business evolution. This includes:? Joint development of new services, workflows, or digital experiences? Proactive recommendations on emerging technologies and strategic bets (e.g., AI, automation, business intelligence)? Participation in OKR planning and innovation cycles across departmentsClients at this level are typically mature and ambitious, with a high appetite for and capability in their field. This is advanced Segment A behaviour—distinct from Business Transformation—where the MSP is not only involved in execution, but follows the client's lead in ideation, co-design, and strategic investment planning.Innovation is no longer a side effect—it’s a shared goal.Concept #2: Innovation Relies on Co-Planning, Not Just Co-DeliveryBusiness Innovation is collaborative by nature. It depends on:? Shared visibility into business priorities, risks, and timing? Regular co-planning sessions that integrate IT into product, operations, or customer experience initiatives? Willingness to explore and experiment—even if ROI is still emergingThis level requires MSPs to master:? Business framing (e.g., how does this enable the CEO’s growth agenda?)? Multi-departmental coordination (e.g., working with marketing, operations, and finance)? Innovation rhythm (e.g., quarterly reviews that include initiative retrospectives and forward-looking pilots)At this level, Discovery and Assessment evolve from needs identification to opportunity mapping. At this level, cadence alignment is critical—integrating innovation discussions into the standard CS rhythm (Annual Planning, Monthly Strategic Reviews, Bi-Weekly Tactical Syncs) ensures consistent visibility and executive alignment.Concept #3: Innovation Requires a Mature and Measurable CS Health SystemClients engaged in Business Innovation expect the MSP to manage execution while contributing insight. That means CS Health scoring must:? Reflect innovation-readiness, not just stability? Track strategic engagement (e.g., presence in OKR reviews, steering committees)? Monitor initiative portfolio complexity and cross-functional alignmentGovernance must evolve from initiative verification to portfolio oversight:? Are innovation initiatives moving at the right pace?? Are experiments being tracked, scored, and refined?? Are results feeding back into the roadmap and budget cycles?Service Quality and Alignment metrics must capture strategic consistency, not just delivery hygiene. CS Health should extend standard measures (CX, Engagement, Adoption, Alignment, Service Quality) by adding innovation-specific signals, such as OKR co-ownership, initiative portfolio pacing, and cross-departmental transformation traction.Concept #4: Innovation Is a Product of Enablement, Trust, and Strategic RhythmBusiness Innovation can only happen when:? Roles are deeply enabled, especially vCIOs and CS Leaders fluent in business strategy, KPIs, and change management? Trust is high, built from years of consistent delivery and strategic value? Rhythm is stable, with a cadence that includes co-planning, innovation reviews, and integrated budgetsEngagement Strategy at this level shifts to include:? Innovation steering meetings? Joint budget forecasting? Portfolio planning aligned with business horizons (e.g., 12–24 month initiatives)The MSP must treat these relationships like strategic programs, not accounts.At this level, the engagement strategy includes Quarterly Innovation Steering Meetings, OKR Portfolio Reviews, and joint planning that reflects shared strategic ownership. The MSP supports, but does not lead—clients drive the process.Concept #5: Business Innovation Is the Feedback Loop Between Strategy and ExecutionAt this level, the MSP is no longer just delivering on client needs—they are shaping what those needs become.Innovation is driven by:? Data: CS Health insights across the portfolio? Friction: Gaps in process, tools, or enablement surfaced during execution? Vision: Emerging opportunities discovered through strategic DiscoveryFor the CS engine, this means:? Discovery opens new possibilities (what could we solve?)? Assessment scopes feasibility and readiness? Proposal and Budget secure executive buy-in? Governance tracks success and renews the loopThis innovation loop reinforces the MSP’s position not just as a partner, but as a strategic differentiator in the client’s go-to-market strategy.
Implementation Process1. Anchor Strategic Co-Ownership through Segmentation and Cadence (1.1–1.2 Strategy)Clients at the Business Innovation level are mature Segment A partners, leading innovation cycles and setting the pace of execution. The MSP must:? Adopt a shared cadence structure: Annual Year-End Strategic Planning, Quarterly Innovation Steering Reviews, Monthly Strategic Meetings, and Bi-Weekly Tactical Check-ins? Use 1.1 Segmentation to maintain innovation-tier governance, and 1.2 Engagement Strategy to formalize cadence ownership between client and MSP leaders2. Evolve CS Health to Reflect Innovation Maturity (2.x Health Discipline)CS Health at this level must move beyond operational tracking to strategic progress signals:? 2.1 Client Experience (CX): Capture executive feedback tied to innovation velocity and initiative satisfaction? 2.2 Engagement: Track cross-departmental initiative participation and OKR cycle involvement? 2.3 Technology Adoption: Measure impact on business process efficiency and department productivity? 2.4 Service Quality: Score project quality and delivery rhythm in the context of innovation execution? 2.5 Service Level Alignment: Align engagement to roadmap cycles and OKR portfolios, with role-based accountabilityHealth data should feed back into governance loops and support portfolio pacing and prioritization.3. Operationalize Innovation-Centric Process (4.x CS Process)? 4.1 Scheduling/Trigger: Tie scheduling directly to OKR planning and roadmap commitments? 4.2 Discovery Intake: Focus on emerging opportunities, competitive insights, and department growth priorities? 4.3 Assessment Intake: Assessments become tools for innovation readiness, not just feasibility—they guide co-funded initiatives, pilot validation, and enablement planning? 4.4 Meeting: Run cross-functional strategy and steering meetings; review OKR progress, roadmap changes, and innovation backlog? 4.5 Initiatives: Initiatives must be:? Scored by innovation impact and complexity? Assigned co-ownership between MSP and department leaders? Synced to OKRs and strategic outcomes4. Deliver Innovation-Aligned CS Outputs (3.x Delivery Discipline)? 3.1 Reports: Executive-level dashboards summarizing innovation progress, business metrics, and delivery alignment? 3.2 Proposal: All initiatives must include business-case framing and return/risk profile analysis? 3.3 Budget: Co-developed budgets supporting multi-quarter initiative portfolios? 3.4 Strategy: Strategy decks presented quarterly, anchored in OKRs and future-state planning? 3.5 Roadmap: Innovation roadmaps governed jointly, structured around department outcomes and executive priorities5. Enable and Integrate Multi-Level Strategic Roles (5.x People Discipline)? 5.1 Roles:? vCxO: Lead strategic framing, initiative co-design, and executive relationship? Innovation Lead: Portfolio tracking, pilot scaling, and advisory facilitation? SMEs (internal/external): Support AI/BI/ERP/IoT delivery planning? 5.2 Responsibilities:? vCxOs and Innovation Leads drive strategic cadence, roadmap clarity, and co-planning sessions? 5.3 Enablement:? Provide role-specific playbooks for innovation consulting, stakeholder management, and OKR governance? 5.4 Compensation:? Incentivize strategic execution, portfolio health improvement, and value realization across business outcomes? 5.5 Governance:? Monthly and quarterly portfolio reviews to assess:? Innovation pacing? OKR alignment? Strategic backlog readiness6. Orchestrate Strategy through Innovation Infrastructure (1.3–1.5 Strategy Discipline)? 1.3 Playbooks: Innovation-tier playbooks must define co-planning flows, department-specific roadmap structures, and multi-phase enablement initiatives? 1.4 Roadmaps: Department roadmaps combine technical timelines and business OKRs, with initiative scoring and health signals? 1.5 Standardization: Standardize strategy decks, proposal structures, and dashboard outputs across clients to enable strategic benchmarking and executive reportingBusiness Innovation is the final stage of Client Business Goal maturity. This implementation process ensures that the MSP operates not beside the client—but from within their growth engine—executing structured innovation at scale.

?? 1. CS Strategy
1. CS StrategyArchitecting Scalable, Segment-Aware SuccessCS Strategy includes five key blueprints:1.1. Segmentation1.2. Engagement Strategy1.3. Playbook1.4. Service Catalog1.5. AlignmentDefinitions: CS StrategyIn Summary[4]Architecting Scalable, Segment-Aware SuccessThe CS Strategy discipline defines the system that ensures everything else in Customer Success works together: people, process, deliverables, segmentation, and tooling. Unlike the other disciplines, which operate at the level of individual clients or engagements, CS Strategy provides the portfolio-wide logic that turns repeatable wins into scalable outcomes. It is the blueprint layer that operationalizes strategic consistency across roles, maturity levels, and service complexity.“Strategy is what makes Customer Success scale—from one team, to one portfolio, to one unified growth system.”A strong CS Strategy allows MSPs to answer the most important operational questions:? Who gets what kind of engagement?? How do we define effort, rhythm, and resources by segment?? Which CS Deliverables apply where, and in what format?? How do we embed repeatability and flexibility without losing relevance?As client maturity and appetite increase, CS Strategy ensures that the rest of the CS system evolves accordingly. For Segment D clients (low maturity, low appetite), it defines lean engagement and delivery defaults. For Segment A clients (high maturity, high appetite), it activates sophisticated playbooks, planning cadences, and service catalogs. It ensures every client interaction, regardless of role or type, is aligned with a strategic foundation.CS Strategy includes five key blueprints:1.1. SegmentationWhat it is: A structured framework for classifying clients using a combination of Client Business Goal level, where Client Business Goal = Maturity + Appetite and financial value (MRR/ARR).How it evolves: From MRR-only tiers ? to manual quadrant assignment ? to health-driven, dynamically updated segments.Why it matters: Segmentation defines everything downstream—playbooks, roles, cadence, meeting scope, and investment strategy. It allows MSPs to scale Customer Success by aligning effort with both value and readiness.How it connects to the Client Business Goal levels: Each goal level reflects a position in the maturity–appetite quadrant, which maps directly to a segment (A–D). This link creates clear engagement tiers tied to both readiness and revenue.1.2. Engagement StrategyWhat it is: A defined model for how often, how deeply, and in what format CS teams engage clients, based on segment, maturity, and CS Health trends.How it evolves: From fixed cadences ? to segment-based rhythms ? to dynamically triggered engagements tied to CS Health.Why it matters: Right-sized engagement prevents resource drain and missed opportunities. It ensures MSPs deliver the right conversations, at the right time, in the right format.How it connects to the Client Business Goal levels: Higher-goal clients require more strategic, planning-focused engagement; lower-goal clients benefit from standardized check-ins. This strategy ensures the cadence fits the client's posture and potential.1.3. PlaybookWhat it is: Standardized workflows and SOPs that define how CS actions are executed per segment, per role, and per engagement type.How it evolves: From basic onboarding docs ? to full SOP libraries ? to segment-specific workflows with defined inputs, outputs, and owners.Why it matters: Playbooks reduce variability and allow the CS team to operate with confidence, consistency, and measurable quality at scale.How it connects to the Client Business Goal levels: Each goal level is associated with different CS activities—support, enablement, planning, transformation, and innovation. Playbooks reflect those shifts.1.4. Service CatalogWhat it is: A documented menu of CS services—ongoing (e.g. reports, check-ins, roadmaps) and project-based (e.g. assessments, transformation plans)—mapped by segment and maturity.How it evolves: From informal “what we do” lists ? to structured catalogs ? to configurable offerings tied to maturity, value, and engagement model.Why it matters: It helps MSPs define and communicate what’s included at each level of service, and ensures CS is scoped and staffed appropriately.How it connects to the Client Business Goal levels:Catalog depth and variety expand with client maturity, from infrastructure assurance at Level 1.1 to co-innovation initiatives at Level 1.5.1.5. AlignmentWhat it is: Templates, rubrics, formats, and procedural consistency that ensure CS Deliverables and Processes are executed uniformly, especially across large portfolios.How it evolves: From team-specific habits ? to org-wide templates ? to tool-driven standardization (e.g. LMx Reports, QuoterX proposals).Why it matters: Drives repeatability, reduces delivery variance, enables training, and improves execution quality—especially in fast-scaling MSPs.How it connects to the Client Business Goal levels: Standardization ensures consistency at lower maturity levels and creates a structure from which strategic customization can emerge as clients mature.Definitions: CS Strategy1. Segmentation The process of grouping your customers based on their technology maturity (how advanced they are) and appetite (their willingness to improve). It helps you provide the right services to the right customers at the right time.2. Engagement Strategy A clearly defined plan that determines how often, how deeply, and in what way you communicate with each customer. It matches your communication and planning rhythm to each customer segment.3. Playbook A step-by-step guide for delivering consistent customer success activities. It details exactly what actions your team should take in specific situations—making sure everyone is on the same page and nothing gets missed.4. Service Catalog A clear list of services you offer, grouped by client segment, clearly explaining what each service includes and how it helps clients achieve their goals. It removes confusion about what’s included, what’s extra, and why it matters.5. Alignment Making sure you use the same processes, templates, tools, and technologies consistently across your entire client base. It reduces mistakes, speeds up delivery, and ensures every customer receives reliable service.6. Client Business Goals A way of describing exactly what clients want to achieve with their technology, based on their maturity and appetite. This goal helps you tailor your services to their specific needs and business vision.7. Capacity Planning Figuring out exactly how much time your team should spend with each client based on their segment and business needs. This ensures you have enough resources to deliver what you promise without overwhelming your team or underserving your clients.8. Touchpoint A planned and structured interaction or meeting with a client—such as a quarterly review or strategy session—that helps maintain engagement and ensure ongoing alignment.9. Client Archetype A simplified way of grouping clients by their attitude towards technology and change, usually defined as Transform, Modernize, Educate, or Sustain. Knowing your client's archetype helps you speak their language and deliver the right services.10. Investment Model A structured method to decide how much effort, money, or resources you should invest in each type of client, depending on their segment and strategic value. It helps ensure that you're spending your time and resources wisely, based on clear strategic criteria.In SummaryCS Strategy is the design system for the entire Customer Success program. It connects what the MSP knows (Segmentation, Health) with what the team does (Playbooks, Engagement) and how it’s delivered (Service Catalog, Standardization). It transforms strategic logic into day-to-day clarity, without sacrificing adaptability.When implemented well, CS Strategy ensures that:? Every client gets the right experience for their quadrant? Every CS role has a clear model to follow? Every deliverable is supported by tools, templates, and standards? Every team can scale delivery without losing strategic depthIt is the anchor of quadrant-aware, maturity-aligned Customer Success—and the system that allows MSPs to grow without compromising client relevance or service quality.

Determine Engagement Cadence (Secondary Segmentation)Putting It All TogetherWhy This MattersAppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?How does it connect to the other parts?Product Links (Lifecycle Manager / LMx)Best Practice: MRR + Business Goal–Based Segmentation
OverviewWhat is the objective?To segment clients using a combination of financial value (MRR) and strategic potential (Client Business Goal level), where Client Business Goal = Maturity + Appetite. This segmentation model enables differentiated engagement, resource planning, and outcome forecasting based on both what clients pay and what they’re ready to accomplish.Why is it important?Segmentation is the foundation of scalable Customer Success. It ensures that clients receive the right level of engagement, insight, and resource allocation, based not only on contract size, but on what they’re ready and willing to achieve. Without segmentation, MSPs over-service some clients and under-invest in high-potential accounts.Segmentation also supports predictive customer segmentation: by tracking changes in maturity, appetite, and health over time, you can adjust your strategy before problems arise or opportunities are missed.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?Because no two clients are alike, and your CS strategy shouldn’t treat them that way. Segmentation helps you:? Prioritize accounts by potential, not just spend.? Allocate time, team, and tools to where they’ll have the most impact.? Standardize playbooks, cadences, and workflows to ensure consistency and efficiency.? Identify which clients need strategy, which need structure, and which need service.? Build a scalable model that evolves as your client base grows ? Align your CS investment model by segment (e.g., Boutique = 9%, Cost Driver = 1%) to guide the allocation of time and energy to each account.By combining MRR with business goal data, you create a dynamic map of your portfolio that keeps CS strategic and sustainable.What is the Customer impact?Clients benefit from appropriate engagement. Strategic clients receive co-planning and innovation; operational clients get reliability and consistency. Segmentation ensures:? Business-relevant conversations for high-goal clients.? Standardized delivery for early-stage clients.? Clear expectations around service levels, planning rhythm, and initiative support.? Transparency about what it takes to “move up” into more proactive CS.Poor segmentation leads to wasted time (on both sides), misaligned conversations, and missed outcomes.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Client Maturity and Appetite drive CS engagementTwo measurable dimensions shape every client’s Client Business Goal:? Maturity – how aligned, standardized, and operationally stable their IT environment is.? Appetite – how engaged, forward-looking, and open to strategic improvement they are.These two axes form a segmentation quadrant that helps MSPs classify clients based on behaviour and potential, not just revenue. This quadrant-based view produces similar client groupings as the ABCD model in Concept #1? Low Maturity + Low Appetite ? Tactical support clients (Goal 1)? High Maturity + Low Appetite ? Efficient but resistant to change (Goal 2)? Low Maturity + High Appetite ? Aspirational clients that need guidance (Goal 3)? High Maturity + High Appetite ? Strategic co-planning partners (Goal 4–5)This model enables MSPs to quickly determine the type of CS engagement that will resonate most and the kinds of conversations, tools, and cadence each client will respond to. It also maps directly to CS Health metrics, strengthening consistency between segmentation models and Health scoring outputs.
Concept #2: Is Client Priority or MSP Economy the Primary Driver?The objective is to make a statement on our current position regarding segmentation in terms of MRR-based methods.The Challenge: Complexity Without ContextAs MSPs evolve beyond break-fix into strategic client engagement, segmentation becomes essential — not just for organizing accounts, but for operationalizing trust and growth. The mistake many make? Segmenting for efficiency before segmenting for relevance.Client outcomes don’t start with cadence. They start with better conversations.The Strategic Reframe: Client First, Economy Second? Primary Segmentation (by Client Goal / CS Intent) Drives content, context, and conversations — including:? Meeting topics and talk tracks? Assessment templates and discovery questions? Strategic goal frameworks and time horizons? AI prompt enrichment (coming with ClientIQ)? Initiatives (coming with service catalog)? Roadmap logic (coming soon)? Secondary Segmentation (by Size, MRR, Opportunity) Drives depth and frequency of engagement, including:? Cadence and meeting triggers? Level of planning and CS effort applied? Role assignment (e.g., CSM vs vCIO vs AM ownership)This two-layer model ensures personalization without complexity. Primary segmentation powers the what and how of the client experience. Secondary segmentation informs how often and how much.What We BelieveMSPs succeed by enabling better business conversations, not by perfectly executing a rigid customer service (CS) playbook. That’s why Lifecycle Manager X is built to prioritize:? Better relevance over better routines? Stronger context over stricter compliance? Strategic insight over templated checklistsPrimary segmentation provides the CS team with a shared mental model of “what success looks like” for each client type. Secondary segmentation ensures those insights are delivered within the MSP’s real-world operational bandwidth.What This Unlocks? For Low-Maturity MSPs: Simple motion, strong relevance — a meeting cadence paired with the right QBR questions, assessments, and goals.? For High-Maturity MSPs: Playbook precision layered on top of deeply relevant segment strategy — allowing them to scale strategic depth.The Bottom LineBy decoupling why and what (primary segmentation) from how often and how deep (secondary segmentation), Lifecycle Manager X helps MSPs operationalize trust at scale, not just by working faster, but by working smarter, with segment intelligence infused at every stage of the Growth Loop.
Concept #3: Touchpoint Thinking – Based on economic driversTouchpoint Thinking is the practical execution layer of the various times we can spend with the clients. Once clients are grouped by - Primary Segmentation (by Client Goal / CS Intent)- Secondary Segmentation (by Size, MRR, Opportunity)Rather than thinking only in terms of meeting frequency, this model asks:“What kind of interaction does this segment need to stay engaged, make progress, and see value?”This approach balances operational scale with strategic depth, ensuring that every client interaction has a defined purpose, format, and cadence tailored to the client's needs and readiness to achieve their goals.
The Four-Touch Model: Frequency ? DepthTo simplify execution across different client types, we recommend a Four-Touch Model that blends cadence (how often we engage) with depth (how strategic or personal the interaction is):Touchpoint TypeFrequencyDepth / FormatPrimarySecondaryVIP TouchWeekly or BiweeklyHigh – Strategic planning, vCIO/vCxO ledA, B--High MRRMid MRRLow MRRHigh TouchMonthlyHigh – Playbook-based sessions, roadmap syncsC, DA, B-High MRRMid MRRLow MRRMid TouchQuarterlyMedium – QBRs, async video summaries-C, DA, BHigh MRRMid MRRLow MRRTech TouchTrigger-basedMedium/High – CS Health alerts, reports--C, DHigh MRRMid MRRLow MRREach model is tied to the Engagement Strategy (1.2) and supports precise role alignment, from strategic business advisors in VIP Touch to automated reports and AI-based check-ins for Tech Touch.Why It MattersWithout a structured engagement model, CS teams tend to over-invest in low-readiness clients and under-deliver to high-potential ones. Touchpoint Thinking helps correct that by:? Ensuring clients receive the right kind of conversation (not just more meetings).? Creating consistency across segments and roles, even as teams scale.? Making it clear how engagement varies by both strategic potential and revenue contribution.It enables MSPs to implement playbooks, reporting, and initiative planning in a predictable rhythm, so that each client's journey feels tailored yet repeatable.
Concept #4: Segmentation Evolves with DataOur CS opinion needs to come from the App’s CapabilitiesEarly-stage MSPs often begin with manual segmentation based on intuition or company size. As CS Health metrics become available (CX, Engagement, Adoption, Service Quality, Service Level Alignment), segmentation can shift to objective scoring. This unlocks:? Auto-assignment to tiers? Trend analysis? Predictive CS planning? Dynamic reprioritization based on real client behaviour and execution qualitySegmenting based on Health Score trends adds a dimension beyond financials, enabling MSPs to identify high-value, low-engagement clients for playbook intervention or scaling back services in misaligned accounts.? Segmentation 2.0 model
Concept #5: Do’s and Don’ts of SegmentationDo:? Combine Client Goal level (Maturity + Appetite) with MRR to form a holistic segmentation model.? Utilize objective CS Health metrics, where available, to inform placements.? Review segmentation annually or during roadmap and planning cycles.? Track segment-level trends to refine strategy over time.Don’t:? Rely solely on MRR or subjective judgment.? Make manual overrides without logging rationale.? Let your segmentation grow stale—client needs evolve rapidly.? Ignore CS Health signals that contradict assumed placement—review and adjust accordingly.This balanced approach ensures segmentation is both strategic and adaptable, forming the backbone of your Engagement Strategy and Playbook deployment.
Concept #6: Role Assignment Reflects Client Readiness, Not Just Contract SizeEffective segmentation ensures that Customer Success roles are aligned with both client maturity and appetite, not just MRR. By mapping role seniority to each segment, MSPs can scale CS delivery without overextending resources or underserving high-potential accounts.“Goal 4-5 = Segment A”? Segment A (Goal Levels 4–5 – Business Transformation & Innovation) Role Levels 4–5: Strategic Partner MSP & Transformation MSP? Typical Roles: Strategic Business Advisor, CS Manager, vCISO, vCxO, BI/AI Consultants, Cloud Architects, Data Analysts? These clients co-plan strategic initiatives with the MSP. CS becomes an embedded partner in executive decision-making, cross-departmental innovation, and OKR alignment.? Segment B (Goal Level 3 – Technology Modernization) Role Level 3: Full-Service MSP? Typical Roles: Account Manager, vCIO? Strategic posture is growing. CS teams begin formalizing assessments, roadmaps, and budget planning. Clients expect proactive insight, and vCIOs help connect IT to emerging business objectives.? Segment C (Goal Level 2 – Technology Enablement) Role Level 2: Proactive MSP? Typical Roles: Service Delivery Manager, Technical Account Manager (TAM)? Here, CS leads structured service delivery—driving alignment, stack normalization, and project execution. These clients benefit from process-driven improvements but have a low strategic appetite.? Segment D (Goal Level 1 – Technology Support) Role Level 1: Break-Fix MSP? Typical Roles: Helpdesk Support, Field Technicians, Owner/Founder? These clients need stable operations, not strategic planning. CS effort focuses on visibility, reliability, and issue resolution. Engagements are reactive or ad hoc.Why it matters: This model provides a scalable role framework that is directly tied to business potential. It avoids the mistake of deploying high-seniority resources to low-readiness clients. It ensures that ??elite roles are reserved for clients with both maturity and an appetite for strategic engagement..
Implementation ProcessThe Strategy Decision Process is the bridge between theory and execution. It transforms conceptual segmentation models into a concrete, operational Customer Success plan. This process enables MSPs to scale intelligently by mapping each client to the engagement strategy that best matches both their business value and strategic potential.It is built on a dual-axis segmentation framework:? Primary Segmentation: Based on each client’s Client Business Goal, which combines Maturity and Appetite scores to determine strategic readiness.? Secondary Segmentation: Based on MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) or total contract value, representing the financial weight of the client to the MSP.Together, these two layers ensure your CS effort is both relevant and sustainable, prioritizing clients who are ready to act while balancing internal resource constraints.Step 1. Decide Primary SegmentationDefine the type of relationship each client requires.Start by evaluating all active clients through the lens of Client Business Goals, which are defined by two core dimensions:1. Maturity (1–5): Reflects the stability, standardization, and alignment of the client’s IT environment.? Low maturity = chaotic, unstructured, high operational burden (1,2)? High maturity = standardized stack, aligned governance, predictable operations (3, 5)2. Appetite (1–5): Captures how open, engaged, and strategic the client is.? Low appetite = reactive mindset, low interest in strategic initiatives (1,2)? High appetite = engaged leadership, openness to innovation and co-planning (3, 5)Once every client has a score from 1–5 on both axes, plot them on a 2x2 quadrant or a 5-level scale:? Low Maturity (1,2)  / Low Appetite (1,2): Support-focused clients ? Segment D? High Maturity (3,5)  / Low Appetite (1,2): Efficient but passive ? Segment C? Low Maturity (1,2) / High Appetite (3,5): Eager but underdeveloped ? Segment B? High Maturity (3,5) / High Appetite (3,5): Strategic-ready partners ? Segment AThis segmentation creates an actionable map of your portfolio, aligning each client with a Customer Success engagement style suited to their business goals, not just their billing tier.Step 2. Determine Secondary SegmentationDefine how often and how deeply you engage based on account value.While the Client Goal defines the type of engagement the client should receive, MRR segmentation determines the amount of it they should receive. This ensures that resources are invested in proportion to revenue contribution, supporting operational scalability.Steps:1. List all clients in a spreadsheet - Include their MRR, and optionally total ARR or other revenue data.2. Sort by total MRR - Order clients from highest to lowest based on current revenue contribution.3. Split the list into four bands representing approximately equal revenue sums, not equal number of clients.? Top 25% of revenue ? Band 1? Next 25% ? Band 2? And so on…4. Assign engagement cadences and effort levels to each MRR band:? Band 1 (VIP) ? Weekly or biweekly meetings, strategic roles (vCIO, CSM, vCxO)? Band 2 ? Monthly cadence, roadmap-led engagement? Band 3 ? Quarterly cadence with playbook-based touchpoints? Band 4 ? Light touch or tech-touch, triggered by CS Health indicatorsThis MRR-informed cadence model ensures clients receive an appropriate depth and rhythm of engagement without overextending CS resources.Putting It All TogetherWith both dimensions defined, each client now has:? A Client Goal Segment (A, B, C, or D) that determines engagement style, meeting content, and role assignment.? An MRR Band that determines cadence, frequency, and operational intensity.This enables you to:? Tailor playbooks: Strategic planning for Segment A, stack normalization for Segment C, and health monitoring for Segment D.? Assign CS roles appropriately: vCIOs for innovation-ready clients, TAMs or SDMs for enablement, and automation for support-heavy clients.? Build a dynamic roadmap strategy: Budget, initiative, and roadmap reviews can scale up or down based on both strategic need and economic priority.Why This MattersMost MSPs default to a single segmentation axis—usually MRR. While convenient, it creates blind spots: high-revenue clients may have low appetite, and low-revenue clients may be fast-growing innovators. The Strategy Decision Process prevents misallocation of effort by revealing these nuances.Whether you decide to lead with Client Goal (for long-term strategic growth) or with MRR (for near-term revenue optimization), the combined model helps you:? Deliver the proper engagement to the right client at the right time? Scale Customer Success without sacrificing relevance or depth? Continuously evolve your strategy based on real client behaviour and potential
AppendixCS Operation Maturity: Client SegmentationLevelSegmentation ModelDefinition1. No SegmentationAll clients are treated the sameNo differentiation by value or maturity. CS activity is reactive and unstructured.2. MRR-Only SegmentationSegment by Contract ValueSegments are based solely on monthly recurring revenue. Used for effort prioritization but lacks strategic alignment.3. MRR + Subjective GoalMRR plus manually selected Client Business GoalClient maturity and appetite are estimated based on informal insights. Manual overrides are required. Health metrics may exist, but aren’t structured or actively used.4. MRR + Health-Based GoalMRR plus calculated Client Business GoalThe client's business goal level is automatically derived from CS Health scores, including customer experience (CX), Technology Adoption, Engagement, Service Quality, and Service Level Alignment. Maturity and appetite are quantified and updated regularly.5. Trend-Based SegmentationPerformance and improvement trajectory over timeClients are segmented based on progress indicators (e.g., health trends, roadmap completion, initiative velocity), which supports predictive Customer Success strategies.How does it connect to the other parts?? Client Business Goal – Segmentation is built on the client’s current business goal level, which reflects their technology maturity and strategic appetite. This ensures that the engagement model aligns with what clients are trying to achieve.? CS Health – Accurate segmentation relies on CS Health metrics to quantify client maturity and appetite. Health scores provide the data-driven foundation for dynamic and objective segmentation.? CS Delivery – The Segment determines the type, frequency, and strategic depth of Customer Success deliverables, including reports, roadmaps, and proposals. It ensures delivery scales appropriately across client tiers.? CS Process – Segments dictate the cadence, workflow complexity, and level of preparation required for each engagement. Process consistency is preserved while adapting to segment needs.? CS People – Segment assignments influence role allocation and team structure. Higher-tier segments may require vCIOs or Strategic Advisors, while lower segments rely on TAMs or service coordinators.? CS Strategy – Segmentation is the starting point for all other strategic decisions, including engagement plans, standard operating procedures (SOPs), service catalog design, and standardization efforts. It aligns internal effort to client value.Product Links (Lifecycle Manager / LMx)Current LMx Segmentation Capabilities:? Partners can manually assign clients into predefined segments (A–D)?

OverviewWhat is the objective?To define the appropriate frequency, format, and depth of Customer Success engagement for each client segment, based on their maturity, appetite, and Client Business Goal level. The Engagement Strategy turns segmentation into action. It ensures that the right conversations happen with the right people at the right time, and at the correct depth—driving strategic outcomes, not just service check-ins.Why is it important?Without a clear engagement strategy, MSPs risk either over-serving or under-serving clients, leading to wasted effort, missed expectations, or disengagement. Strategic engagement ensures CS isn’t just reactive—it’s a planned, proactive experience aligned to both client and MSP goals.It drives:? Predictable delivery of value? Increased initiative, momentum, and acceptance? Better internal resource planning and CS team efficiency? Higher client trust, satisfaction, and retentionAs an MSP, why do I need to do this? Because your most strategic initiatives—and your best relationships—depend on consistency. Engagement Strategy creates the strategic context for Customer Success, connecting initiatives, services, OpEx, and CapEx to business outcomes over time.Without this rhythm, CS becomes reactive and fragmented. With it, MSPs can:? Prevent engagement drop-offs in lower-tier clients? Scale high-touch conversations without increasing overhead? Deliver the correct format at the right time, using defined playbooks? Maintain strong forward visibility to support staffing and delivery planningWhat is the Customer impact?Clients receive the right kind of interaction, at the right time, with the right level of strategic input. When engagement is predictable and tailored to their maturity and appetite, clients see the MSP as a leader, not a vendor.But when engagements are inconsistent or mismatched:? Meetings get skipped or reduced to technical updates? Strategic initiatives lose support? Executive trust declinesA structured engagement strategy builds confidence, continuity, and accountability.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Engagement Strategy Is the CS Operating Rhythm Engagement Strategy defines how often and how deeply each segment is engaged. It is not a calendar of meetings, but a strategic framework that governs the flow of value:? Inputs: Discovery, Assessments, Roadmaps? Outputs: Meetings, Reports, Budgets, Initiatives? Coordination: Playbooks, roles, and timingIt is also the scheduling backbone of CS Health. If rhythm breaks down—meetings missed, initiatives stall, cadence slips—Engagement scores in CS Health decline. The Engagement Strategy ensures that those signals are not random but structured and traceable.Concept #2: Choose Your Engagement Investment ModelEvery MSP, whether consciously or not, invests a percentage of effort into Customer Success. Engagement Strategy makes this investment visible and intentional.Start by defining how much of your time or margin you want to invest in CS—commonly 1% to 9% of MRR per client. Then, shape your segment-specific strategy around:? Cadence (weekly, monthly, quarterly)? Format (live, virtual, async, hybrid)? Roles (vCIO, CSM, TAM, Strategic Advisor)? Meeting Types (roadmap, budgeting, QBR)This ensures Segment A clients receive full strategic attention, while Segment D clients get lightweight, scalable guidance. This model replaces the old “Engagement Investment Model” by embedding it into a living framework. It also aligns with CS Health expectations, enabling Governance to judge performance segment by segment.Concept #3: Ad Hoc vs. Proactive Time AllocationMost CS effort falls into two categories: planned (strategic, proactive) or ad hoc (reactive, issue-driven). A well-formed Engagement Strategy includes a defined ratio—e.g., 60% planned / 40% ad hoc.This balance prevents teams from being consumed by reactive work. It also clarifies:? How much time is available for roadmap reviews, QBRs, and budgeting? How to allocate resources across segments? How to forecast CS capacity needsOver time, mature MSPs should aim to increase the proactive percentage, as this drives strategic execution, reduces firefighting, and improves CS Health.Concept $4: Hourly Rate as a CS Planning MetricTo align CS time investment with financial reality, calculate your internal hourly cost of CS (e.g., $75 per hour). Then apply your MRR-based percentage allocation (e.g., 5% of a $2,000/month client equals $100/month or approximately $1,200/year).Divide this budget by your hourly cost to estimate available CS time. For example:? $1,200/year ÷ $75/hr = 16 hours/year That’s ~4 quarterly meetings or eight touchpoints—enough for roadmap delivery, budget review, and a few follow-ups.This method ensures that strategic engagement is grounded in resource and financial capacity. It also gives you a basis for CS staffing decisions.Concept #5: Engagement Strategy ≠ Playbook What’s the Difference?? The Engagement Strategy defines when and why to engage a client, including cadence, role, meeting type, and depth, based on the segment.? Playbooks define the process for executing each engagement, including agenda, preparation, structure, documentation, and follow-up.You need both. Strategy sets the rhythm; playbooks deliver the value.How It Works TogetherExample:? Strategy: “Segment B gets quarterly roadmap reviews with a vCIO.”? Playbook: “Here’s the template, prep questions, and follow-up structure for a roadmap review.”Playbooks ensure strategic engagement is consistent, measurable, and aligned with CS Health outcomes, including Engagement, Alignment, and Service Quality.Time Allocation Formula (Linking Strategy to Capacity)To make playbook execution scalable, align it with your CS investment using this formula:5% ? 50% ? 40% = Strategic Playbook Time? 5% = % of MRR invested in CS? 50% = Portion reserved for planned (vs. ad hoc) CS work? 40% = Time spent on strategic engagements delivered via playbooksExample: For a $2,000/month client:? $100/month CS budget = $1,200/year? 50% planned = $600 ? 40% = $240/year for strategic playbook time? At $75/hr internal cost ? ~3.2 hours/year for structured engagementsThis anchors your Engagement Strategy to real delivery capacity.Why It MattersWithout a strategy, CS becomes reactive. Without playbooks, it becomes inconsistent. This formula ensures that:? You don’t overpromise what your team can’t deliver? Playbook usage is resourced correctly? CS performance is measurable and scalable
Concept #6 - How many CS, vCIOs do you need? (3 scenarios)Your Engagement Strategy directly determines your CS staffing model. Given the same client base, different strategies require different FTE allocations.Example (100 clients):? High-Touch Strategy (Segment A-focused):? Quarterly meetings + monthly check-ins = ~20 hours/client/year? ~2,000 total hours ? Requires ~1.25–1.5 FTE? Balanced Strategy (Mix of B and C):? ~10–12 hours/client/year ? ~1,000–1,200 total hours? Requires ~0.75 FTE? Tech-Touch Strategy (Segment D-focused):? ~4 hours/client/year ? 400 total hours? Covered by 0.25–0.5 FTE + automationThis concept ties strategy to real-world delivery: CS isn’t just a philosophy—it’s a workload. Matching strategy to headcount ensures you don’t burn out your team or under-serve key accounts.Concept #7: Challenge: Capability MismanagementExplanation: A common mistake is building your Customer Success plans around the ideal service experience without first ensuring you have the right people, skills, or industry expertise to deliver it. True capability isn’t just about headcount; it’s about whether your team has the expertise (e.g., vCIOs, AMs, technical specialists) and vertical understanding needed for each client segment and playbook you want to deliver.Many MSPs commit to services (such as advanced QBRs or industry-specific playbooks) before they’ve mapped whether their staff has the necessary training, experience, or sufficient hours to perform these tasks effectively. If your team isn’t enabled for the service, the result is broken promises, inconsistent client experiences, and staff burnout.Practical Example: Imagine you want to deliver quarterly strategic meetings (QBRs) to all your Segment B and Segment C clients.? You have 30 clients in Segment B and 40 in Segment C.? Each QBR requires a vCIO (2 hours of preparation + 2 hours of delivery = 4 hours per client per quarter).Calculation:? Total QBR hours per year: (30 Segment B + 40 Segment C) ? 4 hours ? 4 quarters = 1,120 hours/year? You currently have only one vCIO with 1,400 hours of availability per year.Now, suppose you also want that same vCIO to run roadmap reviews for Segment A (8 clients, 6 hours per quarter each):? 8 ? 6 ? 4 = 192 hours/yearCombined demand: 1,120 + 192 = 1,312 hours/year (leaving only 88 hours for all other work, meetings, training, or vacation).What happens? If the vCIO is also expected to cover other responsibilities (or if you want to launch new vertical-specific services), you quickly hit a wall. Result: Some QBRs are rushed, postponed, or of low quality; some industry-specific playbooks are never launched, resulting in client inconsistency.Takeaway: Before promising new or advanced CS services, map your real people capability by segment and service type. If you don’t have enough capacity or the right vertical expertise, either upskill your team, reduce CS commitments, or focus your strategy on segments where you can consistently deliver value.Concept #8: Challenge: Capacity MisalignmentExplanation: Most MSPs underestimate the actual time it takes to deliver the CS activities they promise to clients. It’s easy to include QBRs, monthly check-ins, or frequent roadmap reviews in your playbook, but if you don’t align those promises with your team’s actual available hours (and segment distribution), you risk creating overwork and burnout. Capacity planning is essential to avoid overcommitting and underdelivering.Practical Example (with numbers): Suppose your recommended annual CS capacity per segment looks like this:SegmentMRR RangeTotal Annual Hours per ClientMeetings/FormatTotal ClientsTotal Segment HoursSegment A$10,000+30 hours3x QBR + monthly7210Segment B$5k–$10k20 hours2x QBR + monthly18360Segment C$2.5k–$5k10 hours1x QBR + virtual40400Segment D<$2.5k5 hoursVirtual/Ad hoc60300Total1251,270Your total available CS team hours for the year: 1,000.Problem: You have a capacity gap:? Required hours: 1,270? Available hours: 1,000? Shortfall: 270 hoursHow to solve it?? Option 1: Move the segment boundaries upward.? Shift Segment A threshold from $ 10,000+ to $ 12,000+ ? now only five clients qualify as Segment A.? Shift B from $5k+ to $7k+ ? now only 12 clients qualify as B.? The rest move down to C or D, which are less time-intensive.? Option 2: Reduce the average annual hours per segment (e.g., deliver QBRs less frequently or move more C and D clients to ad hoc or virtual touchpoints).? Option 3: Lower your overall CS investment (e.g., from 7% of MRR to 5%), and adjust hours accordingly.Example Table After Adjusting Segment Boundaries:SegmentNew Client CountTotal Annual Hours per ClientNew Total Segment HoursSegment A530150Segment B1220240Segment C4510450Segment D635315Total1251,155Now, the required hours = 1,155 — still tight, but closer to the 1,000-hour limit.Takeaway: If your actual CS team capacity doesn’t match your playbook and segment design, you must adjust either segment boundaries or the level of planned engagement. This keeps your promises deliverable and your team healthy, so only your most strategic clients receive frequent high-touch service, and the rest receive a level of engagement you can sustain.Concept #9: Managing the “Defense Loop”The Defense Loop is a customer success philosophy focused on defending revenue, margin, and incident stability for transactional and cost-sensitive D-segment clients. It aims to make risk visible, align on minimum standards, and assure executives of protection and predictability.Customer Success Defense LoopHere's how to manage the Defense Loop:? Phases:? Risk Visibility: Help clients identify and rank business risks by unifying asset lifecycle, security, and process exceptions in a living register.? Stability Alignment: Agree on the technology stack and service baseline to maintain business stability. This involves setting standards, defining change windows, establishing escalation paths, and sequencing fixes in 30-60-90-day cadences.? Value Assurance: Provide executives with confidence in protected continuity and predictable spending through quarterly assurance briefs, forecasting risks and costs, and running continuity drills.? Operating Rhythm:? Monthly: Automatically intake risks, conduct stability checks, and send a one-page assurance summary.? Quarterly: Deliver the assurance summary during the Quarterly Business Review (QBR) slot, refresh Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and update the 90-day plan.? Triggers: Spikes in incident rates, increasing exception age, or two consecutive months above the cost-to-serve target.? KPI Link to Outcomes:? GRR (Gross Recurring Revenue): Executives renew when risk is visible, standards are in place, and confidence is high.? Margin: Fewer incidents and approved change patterns reduce effort.? Incident Control: Aligned baselines and decision Service Level Agreements (SLAs) reduce noise and recurrences.? Fit with Maturity Model: The Defense Loop can be adapted for different maturity levels, from a light, PSA-based foundation to a strategic partner model with advanced risk scoring, prevention logging, and board-ready reporting.? Connection to the Growth Loop: The Defense Loop protects the existing client base, while the Growth Loop expands value. Defense artifacts, such as risk visibility, stability alignment, and value assurance, can be used in Growth conversations to drive roadmap items, reduce incidents, unlock adoption, and build executive trust.? Positioning for any Managed Service Provider (MSP): Frame the approach as running "two loops: Growth to create value, Defense to protect it." For D accounts, prioritize stability and predictability. As trust grows, migrate clients to higher segments and introduce the Growth Loop. Use client-centric language like "operations," "continuity," "predictability," and "confidence."
Implementation ProcessThe Implementation Process turns your engagement philosophy into a working plan. It helps you define, allocate, and validate Customer Success efforts based on both segmentation and operational capacity.Step 1. Define Your Engagement Strategy ModelStart by determining how much of your recurring revenue (MRR) you are willing to allocate to Customer Success for each segment. This decision determines the scale and type of engagement you can realistically offer across your portfolio.? High-touch strategy: 6–9% of MRR (for top-tier, strategic clients)? Balanced strategy: 3–6% of MRR (for mid-tier, growing clients)? Lean/Tech-touch strategy: 1–3% of MRR (for operational or low-touch clients)Why it matters: Selecting your CS investment model upfront ensures you don’t overpromise (e.g., quarterly QBRs for every client) and that you allocate time and resources proportionally to client value and potential.How to do it:1. Multiply the chosen % by each client’s MRR (or by segment average) to set the annual Customer Success budget per client.? Example: For a $5,000/month Segment B client at 6% investment: $5,000 ? 12 ? 6% = $3,600/year CS budget.2. Convert that annual CS budget into available Customer Success hours:? Divide by your internal average hourly rate for CS team members (e.g., $75/hour): $3,600 / $75 = 48 hours per year for this client.3. Sum these calculations across each segment to set your overall capacity, and check that the total is feasible for your current team size.4. Use this time budget to:? Set meeting cadence (how often, what type)? Define the number of planned vs. ad-hoc touchpoints? Assign roles and responsibilities by segment (e.g., vCIO for A, TAM for D)Practical Example Table:SegmentTypical MRRCS Investment %Annual BudgetInternal RateAvailable HoursSegment A$10,0008%$9,600$10096Segment B$5,0006%$3,600$7548Segment C$3,0004%$1,440$7519Segment D$1,5002%$360$755Defining your CS investment model in this structured way enables you to turn ambition into action, so you can set realistic, segment-specific engagement plans that align with both your business goals and your team’s actual capacity.Step 2. Allocate Time by Segment and Activity TypeBreak that time into planned (proactive) vs ad hoc (reactive) categories:? e.g., 60% proactive = roadmap planning, budgeting, QBRs? 40% reactive = initiative support, escalations, unexpected issuesUse this to define touchpoints and playbook frequency per segment. For example:? Segment A: 16 hrs/year ? four strategic meetings, four follow-ups? Segment B: 10 hrs/year ? two meetings + async reviews? Segment C: 6 hrs/year ? QBR + budget session? Segment D: 2–3 hrs/year ? CS Health check-ins, triggered follow-upsStep 3. Validate Capacity Against CS HeadcountAdd up the total time across all clients. Then compare against your CS team's available capacity:FTE ? 1,680 hours/year (or 140/month)This shows whether your Engagement Strategy is realistically deliverable. If not, adjust:? Reduce cadence or touchpoint depth? Automate lower-tier interactions? Shift delivery from vCIOs to TAMs/CSMs? Reassign roles or delay hiringStep 4. Monitor and Refine Over TimeAs CS Health trends emerge or client goals evolve, reallocate time and effort:? Strategic clients moving up? Shift toward more high-touch.? Low-value clients stagnating? Move toward automation.Your Engagement Strategy should evolve quarterly, just like roadmaps and segmentation.
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?The engagement strategy evolves as the client’s maturity and appetite increase. Different Client Business Goal levels reflect different readiness to engage and different expectations.LevelRole of Engagement Strategy1.1 Technology SupportReactive or ad-hoc check-ins; meetings triggered by issues or service changes.1.2 Technology EnablementBasic cadence introduced (e.g., annual or semi-annual check-ins); focus on stability and onboarding.1.3 Technology ModernizationRegular, structured meetings to track progress on modernization and roadmap execution.1.4 Business TransformationQuarterly or monthly meetings; review business impact and coordinate cross-departmental initiatives.1.5 Business InnovationStrategic, multi-stakeholder engagements aligned to OKRs, innovation programs, and executive-level planning.How does it connect to the other parts?? Client Business Goal – Engagement depth and rhythm evolve with the client’s maturity and appetite. High-Goal clients require more frequent, strategic interactions, while lower-Goal clients benefit from an operational cadence.? CS Health – Engagement frequency and stakeholder participation are key health indicators. Health trends may also trigger adjusted cadences.? CS Delivery – Meetings, Reports, and Budgets are delivered on cadence, powered by Engagement Strategy.? CS Process – Cadence, preparation, and follow-up workflows are structured according to the engagement strategy.? CS People – Determines which roles (e.g., vCIO, CSM, TAM) are involved at each engagement level. Role clarity ensures consistency across segments.? CS Strategy – Engagement Strategy operationalizes the segmentation model. It transforms Client Business Goal and MRR into time, attention, and leadership effort.Product Links / Tooling SupportNo dedicated LMx product feature currently supports Engagement Strategy holistically, but engagement strategy is enabled and informed by:?

OverviewWhat is the objective?To define standardized, repeatable processes for delivering Customer Success activities across client segments, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and alignment with business goals. Playbooks are the tactical execution layer of Customer Success Strategy. They bring cadence, content, and coordination to life, executing the engagement rhythms defined by the Engagement Strategy.Why is it important?Without documented playbooks, CS delivery becomes ad-hoc, inconsistent, and reliant on individual memory or discretion. The Engagement Strategy determines the frequency and type of interaction for each segment (e.g., a quarterly roadmap review for Segment B). Playbooks ensure that interaction actually happens with quality, structure, and accountability. Together, they ensure MSPs can deliver value at scale without sacrificing precision.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?Because success doesn’t happen by chance—it happens by design. You can’t just decide to be strategic—you need to operationalize it. Playbooks are how Engagement Strategy becomes real: not just “when and why” you meet, but exactly “how” to run those sessions and follow up. Without this, even the best segmentation or cadence plans fall flat.What is the Customer impact?Clients experience a delivery model that feels professional, thoughtful, and aligned with their goals. Engagement Strategy ensures the proper conversation happens at the right time; Playbooks ensure that the conversation is structured, prepared, and followed through. Together, they create:? Predictable, high-quality experiences—clients know what to expect and when? Momentum across meetings—each interaction drives the next step in the roadmap? Alignment between vision and execution—strategic goals translate into consistent workflows? Confidence in the MSP’s leadership—clients feel guided, not just supportedWhen strategy defines the "why" and playbooks deliver the "how," clients experience Customer Success that is both relevant and reliable.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Playbooks Are Workflows Each playbook defines a process, from trigger to outcome. A great playbook includes:? Purpose of the engagement (e.g., align roadmap, review budget)? Triggering event (e.g., quarterly cadence, Health Score drop)? Preparation checklist (data, reports, notes)? Agenda or conversation structure? Roles and responsibilities (who leads, who attends)? Follow-up steps and timelinesPlaybooks operationalize CS Health workflows—ensuring that Health Score signals (e.g., low Engagement, missed initiatives, misaligned service levels) result in consistent, team-wide responses. They turn insights into action.Expanded with a Practical Example:A playbook is not just a checklist—it’s a complete, step-by-step system, from trigger to outcome, designed for repeatable execution.Practical Example: Segment A Annual Planning Playbook Suppose you have a high-value Segment A client. Their annual playbook might look like this:StepToolDescriptionTime BudgetTriggerAuto SchedulerAnnual planning meeting scheduled 1 year in advance0.5 hrPrepDiscovery Tool, Assessment Tool, Binder GeneratorCollect client data, generate questions and an assessment report, and print a prep binder.2.5 hrsMeeting 1Printed Binder, Note Tool90-min CEO session—capture business goals, SWOT, current state1.5 hrsFollow-UpMeeting Minutes, Action Item ToolSummarize actions, decisions, and schedule the next meeting0.5 hrMeeting 2Client SWOT/Goals/Initiative DocsReview and confirm priorities, set next steps1.5 hrsBudgetingBudget ToolDraft and review the budget for initiatives1.5 hrsFinalizationSOW GeneratorFinalize SOW, save to system, send to client1 hrTotal planned time for one annual cycle: ~7.5 hours Multiply by the number of clients: 10 Segment A clients = 75 hours/yearThis practical approach shows why you can’t run “Segment A” playbooks for every account—the math is straightforward, and the process is explicit.Concept #2: Not All Playbooks Are Meetings While many playbooks support meetings (e.g., QBR, Roadmap Review), others are structured:? Initiative follow-up and proposal delivery? Onboarding and renewal cycles? Risk response and Health Score recovery? Budget planning and stakeholder approvalPlaybooks provide the standard operating procedure for restoring or advancing CS Health. For example, a low Service Quality score should trigger a remediation playbook. A strong Adoption trend may trigger a strategic upsell or roadmap refresh.Concept #3: CS Playbooks Should Match Client Segment Not all playbooks belong everywhere. Your Segmentation and Engagement Strategy determines which workflows apply where, and with how much effort.Match the playbook’s scope and complexity to the client’s Business Goal Level and CS Investment Strategy:? Segment A – Full pre-meeting prep, multi-stakeholder agendas, strategy alignment, initiative planning.? Segment B – Formal prep and delivery using a leaner version of Segment A’s process.? Segment C – Semi-structured workflows that cover essentials and build consistency.? Segment D – Lightweight, templated, and potentially asynchronous playbooks focused on operational continuity.The goal is consistency without over-servicing. Playbooks help you scale the right level of structure—no more, no less.They also ensure that Health metrics are interpreted in context. For example, a “low Engagement” signal in Segment D does not mean the same thing as in Segment A, and your playbooks should reflect that nuance.Expanded with a Practical Example:The more strategic the client, the more complex and involved the playbook.Practical Example: Segment Comparison TableSegmentPlaybook StructurePlanned HoursExample ActivitiesA3-Meeting Annual Cycle + Budget & SOW7–10Strategic Discovery, CEO sessions, SOWB2-Meeting Annual Cycle4–6Discovery, Planning, Budget ReviewCSingle Meeting + Virtual/Async Touchpoints2–3Roadmap Review, Key Initiative EmailDAsynchronous, Email Only1–2Automated Report, Quick Survey, EmailSo, if you have 20 clients in Segment C, you should expect 40–60 hours/year on C-segment playbooks.Concept #4: Great Playbooks Make the Team Look Great Playbooks are internal tools that power external confidence. A junior TAM with a great playbook can run a roadmap session like a seasoned vCIO. A new hire can onboard clients like a pro. The best playbooks:? Reduce reliance on tribal knowledge? Make team roles clearer? Improve handoff quality? Support accountabilityThey also improve the reliability of CS Health scoring. When execution is standardized through playbooks, Health data becomes trustworthy and consistent across accounts, enabling better forecasting, planning, and governance.Expanded with a Practical Example:Playbooks give even less-experienced team members the tools to deliver high-quality outcomes.Practical Example:? Scenario: New TAM joins and is assigned to a Segment B client.? With Playbook: Follows the “2-Meeting Annual Cycle” template—preps with binder, runs Discovery questions, logs meeting notes, triggers follow-up template.? Result: Consistent client experience, no gaps, same value as vCIO could deliver.? Without Playbook: Meetings become ad-hoc, key topics get missed, follow-up slips, and trust declines.Impact:? Playbooks reduce mistakes, shorten the ramp-up time, and make CS Health scoring more reliable (e.g., eliminating “missed QBR” errors).Concept #5: Strategy and Execution Are a Matched SetEngagement Strategy defines the when, why, and who of CS delivery. CS Playbooks define the how.They must work in tandem:? Engagement Strategy says, “Segment B clients receive quarterly Roadmap Reviews.”? The Playbook says, “Here’s how to run a Roadmap Review—from prep to follow-up.”And Scheduling/Trigger supports both by making sure it happens at the right time. Together, this trio creates a CS engine that is:? Strategically aligned? Operationally repeatable? Executed on time? Measured and informed by CS Health, ensuring that all parts of the delivery system are tied back to the actual outcomes and behaviours they generateExpanded with a Practical Example:A playbook only works if it’s executed as designed, at the cadence set in Engagement Strategy.Practical Example:? Engagement Strategy: Segment B gets two strategic meetings per year.? Playbook:  “Annual Planning Cycle” is triggered twice for each Segment B client.? Calculation: 20 Segment B clients ? 2 cycles ? 3 hours (prep + meeting + follow-up) = 120 hours/year? Check: If your team has only an 80-hour capacity for Segment B, either the cadence or playbook depth must be adjusted.Summary Table: Annual Playbook Workload Planning ExampleSegmentClientsHours per ClientTotal HoursA10880B20480C40280D60160Total130300This calculation helps you see at a glance whether your CS playbook plan is realistic for your team size.Concept #6: Trigger – Meeting Prep CycleA playbook is essentially a repeatable client interaction cycle—not just a meeting, but any structured engagement, including in-person meetings, video calls, phone calls, or even asynchronous communications like email summaries and action items.1. Trigger of the Interaction: The process begins with a trigger—this might be a recurring cadence (quarterly review, renewal), a key event (risk alert, assessment result), or a scheduled milestone. Triggers ensure that every interaction happens for a reason, not just “because it’s time.”2. Preparation for the Interaction: Collect relevant information (Discovery responses, assessment results, previous decisions), prepare documents, create the agenda, and set expectations with the client.3. Executing the Interaction: Run the engagement according to a clear and structured approach. This could be a meeting, a video call, or even a planned email exchange—whatever the client context requires. The agenda drives focus, outcomes, and alignment with client goals.4. Follow-Up: Document action items, decisions, and next steps. Follow-up can be a summary email, a shared task list, or scheduling the next interaction. If anything is unclear or missing, the process loops back to the preparation stage.5. Statement of Work / Output: Each cycle ends with a tangible deliverable—this could be a new roadmap, an updated Statement of Work, a contract amendment, or a project launch.Key point of the cycle: If follow-up reveals missing info or open items, the playbook loops back to preparation, ensuring no tasks are lost and every engagement drives to closure.Practical example:? For a Segment A client, a quarterly review cycle might start with a risk assessment (trigger), proceed to prep (collecting SWOT and business goals), then a video call or onsite meeting (executing), followed by a summary and a new Statement of Work sent via email.Concept #7: Quarterly Example – A Playbook in ActionWhy is this concept important? A playbook is not just a checklist—it’s a structured, repeatable cycle of client interactions, each with clear goals and outputs. Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs) are popular among MSPs because they provide a regular, visible, value-driven rhythm—but it matters which client segments you apply this to.This example is for a $10,000+ MRR Range Segment A – VIP Touch client, where the goal is to establish a strategic partnership, foster frequent high-touch engagement, and engage in multi-level business conversations. Across the year, you typically have three QBRs, but the first client-facing interaction is an Annual Planning Meeting (to set the year’s direction), and the third QBR serves as a major wrap-up or milestone review.Practical example – Quarterly playbook for a Segment A client:PhaseKey Actions & OutputsTriggerAuto-scheduled quarterly reviewPreparationPrepare IT strategy review, compliance report, productivity report, discovery questions, tech reportClient Facing #1Annual Planning Meeting: deep dive on business goals, SWOT, and tech state for the upcoming yearFollow UpMeeting summary, action items, decisionsClient Facing #2Discuss discovery questions, tech report, and present executive reportCS DeliverablesQBR report, IT strategy review, executive report, discovery questions, tech report—each formally deliveredCommercialIn parallel or after: quotes, project scopeClient Facing #3QBR—review project scope and quotesSOW / OutputStatement of Work (SOW)—for new projects or roadmap stepsWhy does it matter?The QBR example is relevant because most MSPs recognize the concept of regular reviews, even if these are implemented very differently from one company to the next. In this Segment A – VIP Touch playbook example, you see how a structured quarterly cadence follows an annual planning meeting, with each step having clear preparation, follow-up, and commercial outputs, such as Statements of Work (SOWs) or quotes. The model demonstrates how a playbook can systematize client interactions, ensure consistency, and provide a visible, repeatable value delivery rhythm, regardless of the segment or exact meeting frequency.
Implementation Process – Turning Capabilities Into Repeatable ActionThe implementation process for Playbooks transforms your strategic customer service (CS) intentions into executable workflows. It connects what your team can deliver, where opportunities lie, and how each client segment should be served—consistently, confidently, and at scale.This process ensures that playbooks don’t just exist—they get used, adapted, and improved across your entire client base, with clear role ownership and measurable outcomes.Step 1: Map What Your Team Can Deliver (Capabilities)Begin by documenting your internal customer service capabilities. These are the real-world services and planning activities that your team can confidently deliver to a client.Examples:? Technology Roadmapping? Cybersecurity Reviews? Budget and Forecast Planning? Digital Transformation SWOT? Cloud Strategy or AI/Automation AssessmentsThis becomes your Capability Library, which defines the building blocks of your CS playbooks.Step 2: Identify Opportunity Areas (Client-Centric Themes)Review your client base and identify where you can add value or expand relationships:? What services are underutilized or unknown?? Which clients have untapped budgets or latent appetite?? Where can you extend coverage (sites, users, projects)?Build playbooks around common cross-sell, up-sell, or initiative triggers—using Discovery or CS Health signals (e.g., high Adoption or low Service Quality) to initiate action.Step 3: Match to Industry and Vertical CompetencyClients expect tailored insights, not generic templates. Classify your capabilities and playbooks by industry verticals where you have genuine expertise.For example:? Healthcare: compliance frameworks, EHR integrations? Construction: mobile workforce optimization, field service tools? Professional Services: secure collaboration, client-facing digital enablementThis ensures your playbooks speak the client’s language—and make your team look sharp and informed.Step 4: Align to Roles and Execution OwnersDefine who in your team owns which playbooks. Map playbook delivery to specific roles, based on complexity, strategic weight, and segment:? vCIO / Strategic Advisor ? Segment A & B strategic playbooks? CSM / TAM ? Segment B & C delivery playbooks? Service Desk / Coordinator ? Segment D operational or async playbooksClarity here supports CS People planning and avoids overloading senior staff with repetitive tasks that can be delegated.Step 5: Define Topics by Cadence and SegmentNow build your Engagement Calendar: which playbooks are used at what rhythm and for which segments.Example – Segment A:? Annual: Strategic IT Plan, Full Cybersecurity Assessment, Growth Alignment? Quarterly: Roadmap Review, Threat Landscape, Initiative Planning? Monthly: Performance Optimization, Stack Alignment? Ad Hoc: M&A Support, Facility Expansion, Strategic ProcurementEach segment’s playbook suite should reflect its maturity, appetite, and budget contribution.Step 6: Validate Team CapacityPlaybooks create work. Make sure your team can execute.? Use the Engagement Strategy time allocation formula (e.g., 5% ? 50% ? 40%) to calculate the number of hours per year available for playbook-driven engagements.? Match this to the CS roles assigned to you.? Adjust your cadence or playbook complexity if you are operating at or above capacity.This ensures your CS Playbook library is not only powerful but usable and sustainable.Final Output: A Playbook Strategy That DeliversBy completing this process, you end up with:? A documented list of your CS capabilities? A mapped set of playbooks per vertical and client segment? Clear role ownership? A time-budgeted execution plan that fits your CS investment modelPlaybooks aren’t just documents—they’re a system for delivering repeatable value. This Strategy Decision Process ensures that the system is built around what you’re good at, what your clients need, and what your team can deliver.

OverviewWhat is the objective?To document, standardize, and map the MSP’s service offerings—both ongoing and project-based—into a structured catalog that aligns with segment tiers, Client Business Goal levels, and the overall Customer Success lifecycle.The catalog supports clarity, consistency, and scalability by mapping services to client segments and business goals. It provides the foundation for proposal generation, roadmap planning, and initiative tracking.Why is it important?Because without a structured service catalog, the Customer Success methodology can’t scale. Services become invisible, misunderstood, or inconsistently delivered, leading to client confusion, missed opportunities, and internal inefficiencies. A well-structured catalog:? Clarifies what the MSP delivers, at which level, and why? Makes services comparable, plannable, and improvable? Reduces ambiguity in delivery and accelerates the sales-to-service handoff? Allows proactive service evolution as client needs mature.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Enables consistent delivery across roles and client segments? Clarifies which services are available at which tiers and why? Reduces rework in proposal creation and initiative scoping? Highlights gaps in the current portfolio versus market demand or client needs? Supports operational planning through better visibility into service capacity and scope? Strengthens internal alignment across CS, Sales, Operations, and FinanceWhat is the Customer impact?? Provides visibility into what they’re receiving today—and what’s possible next.? Builds trust through clearly defined scope, ownership, and timing? Helps clients plan strategically by linking services to their business goals? Encourages service adoption by removing ambiguity? Supports better budgeting and project planning by clarifying expectations? Drives more productive conversations by shifting from ad hoc asks to structured options
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: “What’s in the Box?” – Make Services Visible and UnderstandableMSPs often sell value, but clients hear “IT stuff.” The service catalog is enhanced by transforming abstract services into tangible, understandable components. It answers a fundamental client question: “What am I paying for, and what else do you do?” By clearly listing and describing ongoing and project-based services, the MSP makes its work visible and removes friction in conversations around scope, expectations, and upgrades.This visibility also helps internal MSP teams stay aligned. When proposals, roadmaps, and budget items all pull from the same catalog, everyone’s speaking the same language. It reduces the chance of over-promising, under-delivering, or missing a service the client needs but doesn’t know how to ask for.It also standardizes service-level inputs that directly impact CS Health, especially in the Alignment and Service Level Fit categories. A visible catalog makes it easier to assess whether the client is receiving the right services based on their business goals, and where mismatches are driving low Health scores.Explanation: The Service Catalog must break down your offering into clearly defined, understandable categories and items, so clients know exactly what they are getting and you can demonstrate real value. This transparency is crucial for aligning client expectations, improving internal handoffs, and enabling consultative sales.Practical Example:? Service Category: Managed IT Services? Service: Server & Network Administration? Service Items:? Server OS Administration? Network Monitoring? Incident & Problem Management? Configuration Backup? Availability & Capacity Management? Operations Management? Patch Rollback/Testing? Network Documentation? Firmware Management? Service Category: Cybersecurity Services? Service: Vulnerability & Pen-Testing? Service Items:? External Vulnerability Scanning? Internal Vulnerability Scanning? Penetration Testing? Remediation SupportHow it looks for a client: When a client receives a proposal or a QBR summary, instead of vague terms like “security service,” they see a concrete, checklist-style breakdown: “Your current agreement includes network monitoring, incident management, and external vulnerability scanning. However, you do not currently have regular penetration testing or remediation support in place.”Concept #2: Gaps and Gains – Use the Catalog to Spot OpportunitiesA good catalog isn’t just a list—it’s a strategic lens. When paired with client segmentation and maturity, it becomes a powerful tool to identify gaps in delivery and opportunities for growth. For example, if a Level 3 client hasn’t adopted any alignment services or roadmap planning, the catalog helps flag these as potential next steps. It lets MSPs say: “Others at your stage typically engage in X—shall we explore?”By linking catalog items to Client Business Goal levels, the MSP can tailor conversations, drive upsell without being pushy, and guide the client journey in a way that feels proactive, not salesy. This builds trust and positions the MSP as an advisor, rather than just a vendor offering a list of services.More importantly, it connects the CS Health system to structured planning. Catalog adoption—or the lack of it—can serve as a measurable signal of Adoption readiness, misalignment, or Engagement drop-off.Explanation: A well-structured catalog enables you to instantly identify which services a client is already using and which are missing, based on their maturity, industry, or current business challenges. This enables proactive recommendations and explicit conversations about what’s next.Practical Example: Scenario: During a business discovery session with a financial services client, you learn that their competitors in the insurance industry have adopted Public/Hybrid Cloud Management to handle compliance, scalability, and rapid innovation. Your client expresses interest in exploring this further.How it works:? You run an assessment covering relevant service items:? Cloud Security Posture Management? Workload Migration & Testing? Hybrid Network Integration? Regulatory Compliance Monitoring? The assessment shows your client is missing “Workload Migration & Testing” and “Cloud Security Posture Management.”? Based on the gap, you propose an initiative: “We recommend a Cloud Readiness Assessment and Pilot Migration project, which would help you catch up with industry peers and meet compliance standards. The scope, timeline, and outcomes are already standardized in our catalog—so we can move fast and with clear expectations.”Concept #3: Segment-Driven Service MappingDifferent clients need different things, even if the service behind the scenes is the same. The service catalog enables MSPs to tailor the presentation of services according to the segment. A Level 1 client might only need to know that they have secure backups. A Level 5 client wants to see how “data governance, backup, and compliance policy review” aligns with OKRs. Same engine—different dashboard.This mapping supports scalable personalization. You don’t need 50 different services—you need the ability to present and prioritize your services differently depending on the client’s maturity, appetite, and strategic posture. The catalog is how you organize the mess into something modular, understandable, and value-driven.This tailored presentation also enables more accurate CS Health diagnostics. When services are framed to match segment expectations, the Engagement and Alignment scores reflect proper fit, not noise from miscommunication or scope confusion.Explanation: Service catalogs enable you to map each item to the client’s segment and business goals, providing a customized, value-based presentation for every client.Practical Example Table – Digital Workplace & Collaboration:Service CategoryServiceService ItemGoal Level (Example)Description / Use CaseDigital Workplace & CollaborationMessaging & CommunicationTeams Enablement1.2–1.3 (Enablement)Roll out company-wide instant messaging to support hybrid workDigital Workplace & CollaborationFile Sharing & CollaborationSharePoint/OneDrive Setup1.3–1.4 (Modernization)Enable cloud-based file sharing and department collaborationDigital Workplace & CollaborationIdentity & Access ManagementSSO/MFA Deployment1.2–1.5 (All Levels)Strengthen security, support remote access, and enable SSO for SaaS appsDigital Workplace & CollaborationAnalytics & DashboardsPower BI Implementation1.5 (Innovation)Deliver business intelligence dashboards for executive decision-makingConcept #4: From Services to Initiatives—Catalog as a LaunchpadThe service catalog is more than just documentation—it’s an operational engine. Every service should map to an initiative type or proposal category. This turns the catalog into a launchpad for Discovery follow-ups, Assessment remediations, or Roadmap items. When something appears in a Discovery conversation, such as poor MFA adoption, you can quickly tie it back to a cataloged initiative: “We have a 3-week rollout for that.”This alignment means that services aren’t just things you talk about; they’re things you do. When clients see that every assessment risk or roadmap idea has a corresponding, scoped service offering, confidence increases—and so does project acceptance.When clients see that every assessment risk or roadmap idea has a corresponding, scoped service offering, confidence increases—and so does project acceptance. It also closes the loop in the CS Health system, reinforcing Adoption scores and making Execution follow-through measurable.Explanation: A well-structured service catalog doesn’t just describe what you offer—it connects every service and service item to a standardized initiative or project template, complete with scope, duration, and pricing logic. This means as soon as a client’s need or risk is identified (via Discovery or Assessment), you can instantly generate a ready-to-propose project with clear value, timeline, and investment.Practical Example with Calculation:Let’s say your client’s assessment reveals a gap: they lack modern Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) across their 75 devices. Your service catalog lists “EDR Upgrade” as a standard offering, and behind it is a fixed-scope initiative:? Initiative: EDR Upgrade Project? Scope:? Deploy the EDR agent on 75 endpoints? Configure policies? Test and verify the deployment? Provide staff training? Update documentation? Pricing Calculation:? Base setup fee: $1,500? Per device fee: $75 ? 75 devices = $5,625? Total fixed price: $1,500 + $5,625 = $7,125? Duration: 2 weeks? Deliverables: Completed rollout, handover documentation, staff training sessionHow it works in practice:? During a QBR or after a technology assessment, you see that EDR is missing.? You propose the "EDR Upgrade" project from the catalog, using the pre-defined scope and calculation: “This initiative will take 2 weeks and is priced at $7,125, covering all 75 devices with training and documentation.”? The client gets clarity, confidence, and a clear path to remediation—no custom scoping needed, no vague estimates.Why it matters: This approach lets you move at speed, present initiatives with real business value, and eliminate surprises on both sides. Every project in your catalog becomes a launchpad for measurable action, and your pipeline becomes both more predictable and more strategic.Concept #5: Catalogs and Assessments on the growth loopThe service catalog is not only for sales or onboarding—it drives every stage of the client journey, as visualized by the Bowtie & Growth Loop. Assessments are always done against a catalog, not in isolation, to identify what the client is missing and what the logical next step should be.Practical Example (based on the image):? During acquisition (the left side of the bowtie), a prospect’s needs are compared to your Service Catalog.? Example: “During onboarding, you receive a Stack Assessment, which benchmarks your current environment against our Managed IT Services and Cybersecurity Services. Missing items are highlighted.”? During expansion (right side of the bowtie), growth opportunities are identified by reassessing the client against the Project Catalog.? Example: “After 12 months, a Project Assessment is performed to explore which business initiatives—like a SharePoint deployment, a compliance project, or a new BI dashboard—would create the most value. Each of these projects has a ready-made scope and outcome in your catalog.”Why this matters: This approach ensures that all recommendations are tied to predefined, value-based services and that assessments are not open-ended or ad hoc, but are always targeted at moving the client forward in a structured and scalable way.
Implementation ProcessStructuring the Catalog for Scalable ImpactThe Implementation Process transforms your service list into a structured, segment-aware Customer Success engine. Rather than viewing the catalog as documentation, this process positions it as a strategic foundation—linking every service to a specific point in the client journey, from Discovery to Roadmap execution.This process ensures that services are:? Visible to both clients and internal teams? Aligned to maturity and appetite? Deliverable in a consistent, measurable format? Ready for proposal, roadmap, and initiative integrationStep 1: Define the Catalog Structure by Service Type and SegmentBegin by categorizing all offerings into two delivery modes:? Ongoing Services (recurring activities tied to reliability, compliance, and infrastructure stability)? Project Services (scoped initiatives linked to transformation, modernization, or enablement)Then tag each service by:? Client Segment (A–D)? Client Business Goal level (1-5)? Service Category (e.g., Managed IT Services, Cybersecurity Services, Professional Services & Consulting)This ensures each client sees a tailored service experience aligned with their maturity and appetite, and each CS team knows what they’re expected to deliver at each stage.Practical Example:Ongoing Services (recurring services): Service Category: Managed IT Services Service: Server & Network Administration Service Items:? Server OS Administration — Client Business Goal 1.1, Segment D? Network Monitoring — Client Business Goal 1.1, Segment D? Incident & Problem Management — Client Business Goal 1.1, Segment D? Configuration Backup — Client Business Goal 1.1, Segment D? Availability & Capacity Management — Client Business Goal 1.1, Segment DProject Services (project-based implementations): Service Category: Managed IT Services Service: Server & Network Administration Implementation Service Items:? Server Setup & Configuration — Client Business Goal 1.1, Segment D? Network Infrastructure Deployment — Client Business Goal 1.1, Segment D? Initial Security Hardening — Client Business Goal 1.1, Segment DAll segments (Segments A–D) and Client Business Goal levels (1.1–1.5) are assigned, so lower segments and less mature clients receive only the foundational ongoing services, while higher segments have access to more complex project-based implementations.Step 2: Map Services to Customer Success TouchpointsLink each service to a corresponding CS Process activity to drive integration:? Business Discovery: Services flagged as cross-sell or friction-resolvers? Assessment: Services mapped to remediation or maturity milestones? Initiatives: Services structured into initiative templates for execution? Proposal: Services formatted for quoting and client-facing scoping? Budge: Services linked to cost expectations by segment and cadenceThis allows MSPs to scale playbook usage, reduce proposal rework, and improve roadmap clarity—all using a shared catalog.Example:During a Business Discovery session with a financial services client, it becomes clear that they require a new service: Public and Hybrid Cloud Management.Assessment:Performed assessments reveal gaps in Cloud Security Posture Management and Workload Migration & Testing.Based on these findings, an Initiative is proposed: "Cloud Readiness Assessment and Pilot Migration."The Proposal and Budget are then generated from this initiative, leveraging pre-built project templates within the catalog. This ensures a fast, accurate, and standardized offering that aligns directly with the client’s needs.Step 3: Align the Catalog to Segmentation and Engagement StrategyEach segment deserves a different catalog view and delivery intensity:? Segment D: Focus on foundational services (e.g., backups, patching, monitoring). Use templated language and lightweight delivery expectations.? Segment C: Emphasize enablement services (e.g., stack alignment, BCDR setup and configuration). Use semi-structured proposal templates and standard Statement of Work (SOW) templates.? Segment B: Highlight modernization services (e.g., cloud migration, lifecycle upgrades, policy alignment). Prioritize initiative mapping and proposal-readiness.? Segment A: Elevate advisory offerings (e.g., AI readiness, OKR alignment, BI dashboards). Enable roadmap co-planning and co-ownership models.This tiered approach allows for strategic clarity and CS Health alignment without overengineering.Example Table:Service CategoryServiceClient Business Goal LevelSegmentCloud & Data-Centre ServicesPublic / Hybrid Cloud Management1.3–1.5B–ACloud & Data-Centre ServicesCloud Security Posture Management1.3–1.5B–ACloud & Data-Centre ServicesWorkload Migration & Testing1.3–1.5B–AThis segmentation ensures that Public/Hybrid Cloud Management and its associated service items are primarily presented to mid-to-high maturity clients (Segments B and A), aligning with their appetite for modernization and transformation.Step 4: Integrate the Catalog with Playbooks and GovernanceEach CS playbook (1.3) should reference specific catalog items as expected deliverables. This ensures every meeting, roadmap, or assessment is linked to a scoped offering.Then, use governance reviews (5.5) to:? Audit catalog adoption by segment and CS role? Identify gaps between offered services and delivered services? Flag cross-sell and upsell opportunities based on Health signals (e.g., low Adoption or Alignment)This links the Service Catalog strategy to real-world delivery and CS Health outcomes.Example:For the financial services client described in Step 2, once the "Cloud Readiness Assessment and Pilot Migration" initiative is approved, a playbook is activated to guide the Customer Success team through execution:? Trigger: Approval of Cloud Readiness Assessment initiative.? Preparation: Assign a technical lead, prepare a migration plan, and gather compliance checklists.? Execution: Conduct assessment, pilot migration, and report findings.? Follow-up: Schedule a roadmap meeting to discuss results, next steps, and any necessary budget adjustments.This playbook ensures consistent delivery, clear ownership, and repeatable quality, reinforcing client confidence and supporting measurable progress in CS Health metrics like Adoption and Alignment.Final Output: A Dynamic, Role-Integrated, Client-Facing CatalogBy executing this process, you create a catalog that:? Helps clients see what’s possible and what’s next? Helps CS teams anchor proposals, budgets, and initiatives in consistent offerings? Helps the MSP scale service definition and delivery with role clarity and operational efficiencyA living service catalog becomes more than a reference—it becomes the bridge between strategy and execution, supporting trust, transparency, and transformation across the client lifecycle.

OverviewWhat is the objective?The objective of standardization is for MSPs to introduce unified, standardized technologies across all clients and every major service area (e.g., endpoint protection, backup, email, collaboration). For each service, MSPs designate a single, proven, tested, and supported technology—and, where appropriate, a specific vendor—that will be adopted across the entire client base (unless justified exceptions exist for client size or vertical). This ensures that the MSP’s entire team (including CS, technical, operations, and support staff) is working with the same stack at every client. As a result, Customer Success gains a clear, consistent foundation for health measurement, assessment, reporting, and planning—while enabling faster, less error-prone support, easier training, and fewer exceptions.Why is it important?If every client—or even every service line item—reliies on a different technology, errors multiply, operations become more expensive, and support slows down. Exception management drains resources across CS, technical, and project teams, creating confusion for both clients and the MSP. By contrast, when a single vendor’s technology stack is adopted MSP-wide to cover most (or all) service items within a service or service category, efficiency rises, mistakes fall, and onboarding, support, reporting, and training become far more scalable. This cross-client alignment is the operational backbone of Customer Success, making segmentation, discovery, health scoring, and initiative planning reliable and actionable. Standardized vendor-to-service item mapping also makes the MSP’s portfolio transparent, easier to manage, and future-proof for both the CS organization and the client experience.As an MSP, why do you need to do this?Standardization is essential for scaling, efficiency, and clarity—not just for a single client, but across your entire managed client base. When all services and their underlying technologies are unified MSP-wide, you avoid the pitfalls of ad-hoc exceptions and reduce the chaos of managing multiple disparate solutions. This approach:? Empowers the CS team to evaluate every client environment against the same standards during Discovery and Assessment, making health signals and risk factors transparent and comparable.? Enables the creation of a single, unified service catalog that supports proposal generation, roadmap design, and budgeting at the portfolio level.? Allows for the assignment of recommended vendors to each service line item, establishing clear guidelines for quality, support, and future planning.? Facilitates scalable onboarding, training, and reporting—no matter which team member or client is involved.? Reduces operational and technical risk by eliminating unnecessary variability, accelerating support, and simplifying escalation and troubleshooting.What is the Customer impact?For customers, MSP-wide alignment means transparency, reliability, and better outcomes:? Clients always know which technology is being used and why, with the assurance that their environment aligns with proven, supported, and regularly reviewed standards.? Decision-making is easier when recommendations are built on a clearly defined, portfolio-wide stack, supported by deep MSP expertise.? Support, project delivery, and upgrades become more predictable and faster, since all teams work from the same technology playbook.? Initiatives for improvement or change (from Business Discovery through to Assessment, Meeting, Initiatives, and Roadmap) are grounded in consistent logic, allowing value and progress to be visible to both the client and the MSP.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Alignment = Portfolio-Wide Stack + Vendor MappingAlignment is not a custom-fit project for individual clients; it’s the deliberate selection and enforcement of a unified stack and vendor set across the MSP’s entire client portfolio. For every major service area—endpoint security, backup, collaboration, identity, cloud, and more—the MSP identifies a single (or, at most, a shortlist of proven) technologies and vendors to be deployed everywhere possible.? The objective is not to “force” every client onto the stack, but to guide, propose, and recommend adoption, so the maximum possible proportion of the client base benefits from the same platform.? This is not just about tool rationalization; it’s about making CS, onboarding, project delivery, training, documentation, and reporting easier, cheaper, and more reliable for all clients.? A portfolio-level vendor mapping is the critical backbone for scale: it clarifies who supports what, ensures fast upskilling, and makes health scoring, budgeting, and strategic reporting consistent across every engagement.Explanation:Standardization means defining a unified technology stack and preferred vendors across your entire client portfolio for key service areas (e.g., Device & Endpoint Management, Backup-as-a-Service (BaaS), Productivity & Collaboration Suite Management). This consistency allows your MSP to streamline onboarding, training, support, and reporting.Practical Example:Your MSP standardizes on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for endpoint security across 90% of clients, rather than supporting multiple antivirus solutions. This enables you to:? Train your support staff once on the Defender platform.? Develop a single assessment template that evaluates Defender configurations to ensure consistency and accuracy.? Use a shared vendor management process with Microsoft for licensing and updates.? Develop a standardized Defender-focused assessment that evaluates endpoint security posture uniformly across all clients.? Develop a standardized playbook to guide CSMs through quarterly security review meetings, focusing on Defender configuration and threat monitoring.? Create a unified roadmap template linking Defender upgrade initiatives to client risk reduction goals and scheduled quarterly milestones.? Utilize a pre-built proposal template that outlines Defender deployment phases, costs, and expected security outcomes for expedited client approvals.? Prepare standardized budgets that forecast Defender licensing, deployment services, and ongoing support costs, aligned with client size and segment.Concept #2: The Standard Stack Structures the Entire CS SystemA standard stack is much more than a technical foundation. It serves as the organizing principle for every CS discipline—from segmentation, engagement strategy, and playbooks to service catalogues, budgeting, assessments, and beyond.? When the majority of clients use the same stack, the MSP can build assessment templates, roadmap models, and reporting workflows that are reusable, consistent, and benchmarked across the whole book of business.? This means health, alignment, and adoption scores are measured with the same criteria everywhere, enabling trend analysis and benchmarking that are truly meaningful.? This also unlocks the ability to automate playbook triggers, build CS Health alerts based on deviations from the standard, and run health and risk reviews across the entire client base, not just piecemeal.Example: The service catalog is mapped to the standard stack, and any deviation (e.g., a client using Dropbox instead of M365 for file sharing) triggers CS Health issues and a documented opportunity in the roadmap.Explanation:The chosen standard stack isn’t just a technical choice—it underpins all Customer Success activities from segmentation and playbooks to assessments and roadmaps. Using the same stack across clients allows for reusable templates and benchmarking.Practical Example:When all clients use the same backup platform (e.g., Veeam), your assessment reports can automatically flag deviations (e.g., missing backups) with uniform severity ratings. Your roadmap templates then consistently recommend the same upgrade path or best practices, accelerating planning and reducing client confusion.Concept #3: Technology Integration and Compatibility at ScaleSelecting the standard stack is not only about picking the “best” tool for each service; it’s about designing a portfolio-level architecture where all parts fit together, and where integration, support, and upgrades can happen smoothly, at scale.? This requires a systematic review of how well each vendor’s solution supports all service items within a service or service category, and how each integrates with the rest of the standard stack.? Portfolio-wide integration is always the priority. If exceptions are necessary (due to industry requirements or legacy constraints), these should be documented, tracked, and scheduled for phased migration wherever possible.? Regular (e.g., annual) reviews of the standard stack, with collaboration between CS and technical teams, ensure the stack stays current, and any planned transitions are aligned with the MSP’s Customer Success rhythms, not just ad hoc tech pushes.Explanation:Standardization involves selecting tools that integrate seamlessly within the portfolio’s overall architecture, thereby minimizing friction and operational overhead. This ensures scalable deployments and fewer client-specific exceptions.Practical Example:MSP selects a collaboration platform (e.g., Microsoft Teams) that integrates with your ticketing, monitoring, and identity management systems as well as client tools. This means:? Automated user provisioning tied to identity tools.? Seamless alerting for collaboration outages within your PSA.? Unified reporting across all clients on collaboration health.Clients experience faster issue resolution and better cross-team collaboration, while MSP teams benefit from streamlined workflows and reduced manual coordination.Concept #4: Vendor Mapping—Comprehensive, Not Ad-HocVendor mapping must be done systematically and for the entire portfolio, not just one-off for special clients or projects:? Every service line item, under every service and service category, is mapped to the preferred vendor(s) that can best deliver the requirements. The goal is to have as few exceptions as possible, to maximize repeatability.? Where a single vendor can cover 80–90 %+ of items in a service category, this is almost always the preferred approach.? Where integration between vendors is required, technical teams and customer service (CS) must document and communicate the data flows, handoffs, and potential failure points.? Vendor mapping must be visible and updated across the entire portfolio. If new vendors are added or stack changes made, updates are rolled out as a planned transition (never in isolation), and always with clear communication to all CS and technical staff.Explanation:Vendor mapping must cover every service line item portfolio-wide, with minimal exceptions, to avoid operational complexity. This creates clarity about who supports what and where risks or overlaps exist.Practical Example:For your managed email service, your MSP designates Google Workspace as the preferred vendor for 85% of clients, with detailed documentation on integration points and escalation paths. Exceptions for special clients (e.g., in regulated industries) are documented and scheduled for eventual migration. This avoids support confusion and enables faster training and troubleshooting.Concept #5: Stack-Based Advisory, Enablement, and CS HealthA standardized stack across most of the portfolio turns Customer Success into a proactive, advisory, and metrics-driven function:? Discovery & Assessment: In every business discovery ? assessment ? meeting ? initiative, ? roadmap cycle, CS teams use the standard stack as the baseline for gap analysis. For example, if a client is using non-standard backup or lacks multi-factor authentication (MFA), these are flagged as risk and maturity issues.? Health Scoring: The technology adoption metric becomes highly objective: if a client’s usage of standard technologies is incomplete, their adoption score is lowered (and, for example, their Service Level Alignment or Engagement scores can also be flagged).? Technology Adoption = (Number of Service Items on Standard Stack) / (Total Relevant Service Items)? This percentage can be trended quarter-over-quarter, portfolio-wide, for real CS impact analysis.? Enablement: Training materials, onboarding templates, and QBR agendas are all rooted in the standard stack, making onboarding, upskilling, and documentation faster and more reliable.? Client Value: Clients experience quicker improvement, more actionable recommendations, and more consistent long-term support—because the advice, reporting, and training they receive is rooted in a real, proven foundation, not in ad-hoc guesswork.Explanation:A standard technology stack becomes the foundation for advisory services, training materials, enablement workflows, and CS Health scoring. Deviations from the standard stack highlight risks and opportunities.Practical Example:During Discovery or Assessment, your team identifies a client using a non-standard backup solution. This triggers a CS Health alert, lowering their Technology Adoption score. The MSP’s roadmap includes a “Backup Standardization Initiative” from the catalog, with training sessions planned for the client’s IT team. This proactive advisory and enablement help raise the client’s maturity level and adoption score over time.
Implementation Process Step 1: Comprehensive Service/Service Item Inventory and Vendor Mapping? Inventory all services across every service category in the MSP’s portfolio—both recurring (managed) and project-based.? Decompose each service into granular service items (e.g., “Endpoint Security” splits into EDR, patch management, device encryption, etc.).? Map one or more preferred vendor technologies to every service item:? For each service, identify the technology or vendor that can reliably cover the broadest range of service items.? Prioritize solutions that enable portfolio-wide scale, easy deployment, and proven support.? Document the degree of integration between technologies across all service categories:? Prefer vendors and products that support robust integrations, minimize friction, and complement the rest of the stack.? Identify potential overlaps, gaps, or integration challenges as early as possible.? Align vendor mapping decisions with business criteria:? Consider supportability, training requirements, product roadmap, and vendor stability.? Factor in client vertical or regional requirements only where necessary; default to unified solutions wherever possible.? Practical Tip: Maintain this inventory as a living document, accessible to CS, technical, and project teams, and use it as the foundation for every proposal, assessment, and client onboarding.Step 2: Standard Stack Assessment and Mapping? Classify service items and technologies by their impact on client maturity, appetite, and operational priorities:? Flag service items as “core,” “advanced,” or “optional” for each Client Business Goal level (1–5).? Note which technologies are mandatory for baseline compliance, security, or insurability.? Identify which technologies support business enablement (e.g., collaboration, automation, analytics).? Use the stack as a benchmark during every Discovery, Assessment, or periodic review:? Identify and record all non-standard technologies or exceptions at each client.? Map client gaps or outlier solutions to the corresponding standardized alternatives, ready for future CS-driven initiatives.? Integrate stack mapping into CS Health scoring:? Define how deviations from the standard stack negatively impact health and alignment metrics.? Use “stack conformance” as a visible, trackable metric across the entire portfolio.? Practical Tip: Make these benchmarks visible in internal dashboards and client-facing health reports, so gaps become clear drivers for roadmap, initiative, and budget discussions.Step 3: Versioning and Portfolio-wide Review? Schedule regular (e.g., annual or semi-annual) portfolio-wide reviews of the standard stack:? Include input from CS, project, security, and technical leads, ensuring both business and technical voices are heard.? Review industry trends, vendor roadmaps, integration feedback, and client needs.? Evaluate stack performance across all clients:? Analyze support metrics, incident reports, and enablement feedback for each technology to inform decision-making.? Identify which stack elements are delivering the most value, and where pain points or new needs are emerging.? Plan stack changes and upgrades portfolio-wide:? Coordinate transitions: Develop rollout and enablement plans to ensure all teams (CS, tech, training, and project) and all clients are prepared for the shift.? Avoid fragmented or one-off migrations—ensure stack evolution is a planned, strategic process that minimizes disruption.? Communicate the change rationale to both internal teams and clients:? Share why new technologies are selected, how transitions will happen, and what benefits are expected.? Prepare updated onboarding, enablement, and client training materials before changes go live.? Practical Tip: Use the version history to inform future audits, compliance reporting, and M&A due diligence.Step 4: Advisory, Enablement, and CS Support Built on the Standard Stack? Anchor all CS processes to the standard stack—no exceptions:? Every Discovery, Assessment, Meeting, Initiative, and Roadmap is structured around the current, portfolio-wide standard stack.? Enable CS and technical teams with ready-to-use templates, training, and conversation guides:? Develop standardized “Why We Use This Stack” narratives for every major service area.? Prepare risk/benefit guides and business impact explanations for client conversations.? Integrate standard stack conformance into every CS Health workflow:? Health scoring, initiative prioritization, and segment assignment should all reflect the degree of stack adoption at each client.? Automated triggers in the CS platform can flag non-standard elements for future action.? Leverage the standard stack to drive measurable improvements:? Utilize stack conformance to expedite onboarding, minimize support escalations, and optimize roadmap execution.? Track the impact of initiatives and service adoption across the portfolio for continuous improvement.? Practical Tip: Standard stack adoption should become a key performance indicator for both CS and technical teams, recognizing and rewarding teams for driving portfolio-wide alignment.

?? 2. CS Health
2. CS HealthMeasuring What Matters in Customer SuccessCS Health includes five key blueprints:2.1. Client Experience2.2. Technology Adoption2.3. Engagement2.4. Service Quality2.5. Service Level AlignmentIn SummaryMeasuring What Matters in Customer SuccessOnce the client's business goal is defined, the next step is understanding how well the client is progressing toward that goal and how effectively the MSP enables that progress. CS Health provides the metrics and signals that surface early risks, guide prioritization, and validate impact. Each health category connects to a different client experience and maturity facet, helping MSPs build context-aware Customer Success at scale.Without clear health signals, CS becomes reactive. CS becomes predictive and adaptive with theme, allowing MSPs to evolve client engagement based on real-world signals, not assumptions.“You can’t manage what you don’t measure. CS Health tells you which clients are thriving, which are stagnating, and what needs to change.”CS Health includes five key blueprints:2.1. Client ExperienceWhat it measures: How clients perceive their overall relationship with the MSP, including communication, reliability, professionalism, and trust.Why it matters: A positive experience builds trust, renewals, and strategic access. Poor experience erodes all other delivery value, even when execution is strong.How to track it:? CSAT and post-meeting surveys? Manual sentiment input? NPS and complaint tracking? Decision-maker relationship strengthBusiness Goal connection: CX becomes more strategic as clients mature. In Segment D, satisfaction with service is reflected. Segment reflects trust in roadmap co-ownership and advisory leadership.High CX reinforces Client Engagement—a core axis in the segmentation quadrant—and reveals whether appetite is increasing.2.2. Technology AdoptionWhat it measures: How effectively clients adopt and use the technologies recommended or managed by the MSP.Why it matters: Unadopted tools create no business value. Adoption is a key predictor of transformation readiness, initiative success, and ROI realization.How to track it:? LMx Digital Maturity Index (DMI)? Feature/stack utilization? Onboarding and change management completion? Asset lifecycle and compliance alignmentBusiness Goal connection: Adoption drives movement from Enablement (Level 1.2) to Modernization and beyond. DMI acts as a maturity proxy, informing segmentation, planning, and roadmap scoping.Adoption scores inform the Client Maturity axis in segmentation, helping predict readiness for more strategic services.2.3. EngagementWhat it measures: The rhythm, depth, and quality of client interactions, especially those tied to CS strategy, planning, and execution.Why it matters: Engagement enables influence. Low engagement weakens advisory value and signals risk; high engagement fuels momentum and initiative follow-through.How to track it:? Meeting frequency and stakeholder participation? Follow-up adherence and action item tracking? Touchpoint variety (strategic vs. operational)? Communication responsivenessBusiness Goal connection: As clients mature, engagement evolves—from reactive tickets to proactive collaboration. Engagement is the other half of the Client Segmentation quadrant, paired with Impact. Low engagement in high-impact clients signals a gap in trust or strategy that CS must address.2.4. Service QualityWhat it measures: How consistently services are delivered relative to client expectations and internal standards.Why it matters: Quality is the foundation of trust. Strategic initiatives fail when basic service fails. Reliable execution underpins roadmap credibility.How to track it:? SLA adherence (response + resolution)? Incident metrics (volume, root cause)? QA or audit logs? Client feedback on delivery consistencyBusiness Goal connection:Quality issues often drag down Client Impact, even when maturity and appetite grow, especially in Segment B and C clients. Quality issues often drag down Client Impact, even when maturity and appetite grow, especially in Segment B and C clients.2.5. Service Level AlignmentWhat it measures:How well the services being delivered match the client’s maturity, appetite, segment, and strategic goals.Why it matters: Misalignment creates friction, either by over-servicing passive clients or under-serving strategic ones. Alignment enables scale without compromising relevance.How to track it:? CS effort vs. Engagement Strategy by segment? Over/underservicing flags? Playbook adherence and cadence tracking? Roadmap coverage vs. initiative targetsBusiness Goal connection:Alignment reflects the transition from standard delivery to co-planned outcomes. The more mature and engaged the client, the more tailored the services must be.This is the integrator across all quadrants. Misalignment reveals mismatches between health score data and delivery model, often signalling readiness for segmentation review.
Definitions: CS Health1. Client Experience (CX) How your customers feel about their interactions with your MSP. It measures things like trust, satisfaction, and overall impression of your service quality, usually through surveys or direct feedback.2. Technology Adoption How effectively and consistently your customers are using the technology solutions you’ve provided or recommended. If technology is deployed but not properly used, it doesn't add value.3. Engagement How actively and regularly your customers participate in meetings, discussions, and strategic planning with your team. Good engagement means customers are responsive, attend meetings, and show interest in working together.4. Service Quality The consistency and reliability of your MSP's service delivery. It means your team resolves issues quickly, communicates clearly, and meets service expectations without surprises or errors.5. Service Level Alignment How closely the services you provide match the customer's actual needs, maturity, and strategic goals. Good alignment means customers get exactly what they need—not too much, not too little.6. Digital Maturity Index (DMI) A simple scoring system that measures how effectively your customers are adopting and using recommended technologies. It helps you easily see if customers are improving or falling behind.7. Net Promoter Score (NPS) A popular, easy-to-understand survey question asking customers how likely they are to recommend your service to others. It shows how satisfied and loyal your customers are.8. Health Score A combined score made up of Client Experience, Technology Adoption, Engagement, Service Quality, and Service Level Alignment. It gives you a quick, overall view of your customer's relationship health and predicts risk or growth.9. Health Indicator Specific signals or metrics that help you quickly see if a customer is thriving, stable, or at risk. Examples include missed meetings, reduced usage, unresolved issues, or complaints.10. Churn Risk The likelihood that a customer might leave or reduce their business with you. It's influenced by factors like low engagement, poor service quality, or misalignment between services provided and actual needs.In SummaryCS Health enables proactive, personalized Customer Success by showing where clients are today—and what’s likely to happen next. It connects directly to appetite, maturity, engagement, and impact—the four strategic indicators used to segment and prioritize.When tracked holistically, CS Health fuels better segmentation, sharper role targeting, more relevant playbooks, and a rhythm of delivery that aligns with client growth.When done right, CS Health becomes the real-time customer success dashboard, turning goals into measurable milestones and delivering impact at scale.

OverviewWhat is the objective?To measure how clients perceive their experience with your MSP across touchpoints like communication, responsiveness, meetings, and professionalism. It reflects trust, not just technical success. It is operationalized with a simple 3-question pulse after strategic sessions (QBR/Strategy/Service Review), a monthly Green/Yellow/Red colour, and clear ownership (RACI: CSM Accountable, TAM provides adoption/lifecycle inputs, vCIO consulted for A/B).Why is it important?? Client Experience is a leading indicator of relationship health and loyalty.? Even with solid delivery, a poor experience erodes trust.? Strong CX builds advocacy, increases renewals, and deepens engagement.? It creates an early-warning system: CX colour changes automatically trigger small, named playbooks (Health ? CTAs) instead of debates.? It ties directly to outcomes you care about (GRR/NRR) and is evidenced in QBR/JSP-Lite notes (decisions, owners, dates).As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Identify relational risk early and route it to the right owner within 72 hours (time-to-first-action SLA).? Adjust delivery, cadence, or stakeholder mix based on what clients feel.? Run CX with lightweight guardrails: one-screen pulse, monthly colour rules, and response-rate targets (A/B ≥50%, C/D ≥30%).? Keep data where it belongs: pulse results in the CS/Health workspace, decisions in PSA, stakeholders in CRM—so your dashboards match reality.What is the Customer impact?? Clients feel heard and respected, not just “worked on.”? Every recap includes a 2-line “we heard / we changed,” plus a maximum of two decisions with owner/date and the next checkpoint.? Faster approvals and clearer priorities because sessions stay relevant to business goals.? A consistent, predictable rhythm (prep ? Health ? Roadmap ? decisions) that builds trust and renewal readiness.? Supports transparency and builds trust in both people and process.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: CX = 2-question pulse + sponsor heartbeat + complaint log (G/Y/R)Typical MSP cases solved? NPS/CSAT “looks fine,” yet renewals feel shaky, and execs are absent.? Teams chase smiley scores instead of fixing cadence, relevance, or follow-through.? Positive ticket feedback masks weak roadmap/value conversations.How to apply? Track 3 inputs monthly: (1) post-meeting pulse (2 questions), (2) exec relationship signal (sponsor seen ≤120 days), (3) complaint/missed-expectation log with root-cause tag.? Roll into G/Y/R per account (e.g., Green if pulse ≥4.5/5 and sponsor seen and zero open complaints).? Set a guardrail: 2 consecutive CX Reds ? expansion credit gate (until Yellow/Green returns).Practical examples? Pulse questions: “Was this meeting valuable?” / “What was missing?” (1–5)? Exec signal: “Has an exec sponsor attended in the last 120 days? (Y/N)”? Root-cause tags: Cadence | Relevance | Follow-through | Quality.Common pitfalls? Long surveys no one answers.? Treating CX as an AM “soft skill” vs. system signal.? Collecting data without a first-action SLA.Concept #2: CX Is the Visible Output of CS Execution QualityTypical MSP cases solved? Technically correct delivery, but clients feel “lost” (no recap, unclear next steps).? Handoffs between CSM ? TAM, ? vCIO are inconsistent; meetings become repetitive.? QBRs record activity, not decisions.How to apply? Add a 5-point Meeting Quality Checklist to every strategic touchpoint: clear purpose, max two decisions (or limit to two asks), owner/date, recap ≤48h, link to roadmap.? Track two simple KPIs: % meetings with recap ≤48h (target ≥95%) and % meetings with at least one logged decision (target ≥70%).? Reference the QBR credit gate (owner + date + budget) before counting expansion.? Also set First-Action SLA ≤72h on any new complaint entry (owner + due date).Practical examples? Recap template: “What we decided / Why now / Owner & date / Risks / Next cadence.”? Dashboard widget: “Recap ≤48h” by account (Red if <90% last 30 days).Common pitfalls? Slide parades with no decisions.? Treating the recap as optional.? Counting “verbal approvals” without artifacts.Concept #3: CX Drives Retention When Built on Strategic RelevanceTypical MSP cases solved? Fast responses, happy ticket CSAT—yet renewals stall; proposals feel off-target.? Meetings are “busy” but not tied to outcomes execs care about.How to apply? Start every QBR with a 1-screen “Business Outcomes Snapshot” (OKRs/risks, last quarter decisions, two proposed approvals).? Tie each recommendation to “Why this / Why now / Expected impact” and **limit to max two decisions (two asks).? Calibrate by segment: A = OKR link + exec sponsor; B = roadmap + budget cadence; C = lifecycle hygiene + quick wins; D = reliability + clarity.Practical examples? Segment C: TAM runs Lifecycle Review, closes 1–2 quick wins before any new project ask.? Segment A: vCIO anchors two initiatives to exec OKRs; AM confirms budget frame.Common pitfalls? Selling features vs. outcomes.? Too many asks; no prioritization.? Tech-first language that loses non-technical stakeholders.Concept #4: CX Is the First Health Score—and the Easiest to OverlookTypical MSP cases solved? Quarterly NPS gathered, then ignored; early churn signals missed.? Complaints logged in tickets but never rolled up to Health.How to apply? Any Red CX event ? auto-create CTA with owner and due-by (First-Action SLA ≤72h).? Tag each issue with a root cause and review monthly in CS Ops; adjust cadence or playbooks accordingly.? Escalation by segment: A/B = vCIO review ≤7 days; C/D = CSM/TAM fix ≤7 days and confirm.Practical examples? Monthly “CX Watchlist”: accounts with **2+ CX Reds or ≥120 days since exec sponsor seen..? Portfolio widget: Time-to-first-action on CX Reds (target ≤72h).Common pitfalls? Over-surveying without action.? Hiding negatives to “protect” scores.? Treating CX in isolation from Engagement/Quality signals.Concept #5: CX Feedback Loops Strengthen Every CS DisciplineTypical MSP cases solved? Recurring comments (“meetings repetitive,” “unclear next steps”) never change the process.? The same enablement gaps reappear; there are no template or playbook updates.How to apply? Route CX themes into quarterly governance: update agendas, playbooks, and templates; add or remove steps in the campaign runbook.? Feed CX patterns into segmentation and proposal pacing (e.g., weak CX + low engagement ? resequence roadmap before new asks).? Close the loop with clients: “We heard X; we’re changing Y; you’ll see Z next cadence.”Practical examples? If “repetitive meetings” appear≥3 times in a quarter ? switch to JSP-Lite + two-decision format for that segment.? Add a “CX Themes” box to QBR prep: top 2 positive, top 2 to improve, planned change.Common pitfalls? One-off apologies instead of systemic fixes.? Changing too much at once (lose repeatability).? No named owner for CX theme actions.
Implementation ProcessOperationalizing CX as the Frontline Health IndicatorThe Client Experience (CX) Implementation Process enables MSPs to proactively track, interpret, and act on client perception across all segments. CX uses three simple inputs (2-question pulse, exec-sponsor heartbeat, complaint log) with G/Y/R thresholds, is reviewed on a light weekly/monthly cadence, and auto-creates CTAs on Reds (First-Action SLA ≤72h). QBRs remain the evidence anchor (recap ≤48h, max two decisions, owner/date, budget for credit).Step 1 — Define the 3 CX inputs and G/Y/R thresholds (segment-aware)Goal: Standardize what “good CX” means and how it’s scored.Owner: CS Lead (+ CS Ops/AM).Do this:? Lock the three inputs per account:? Post-meeting 2-question pulse (“Was this valuable?” / “What was missing?” 1–5).? Exec-sponsor heartbeat (seen ≤120 days).? Complaint / missed-expectation log (with root-cause tag: Cadence | Relevance | Follow-through | Quality).? Set G/Y/R thresholds (start point; tune by segment):? Pulse: Green ≥4.5, Yellow 4.0–4.49, Red <4.0.? Sponsor: Green if seen ≤120d, Red if >120d.? Complaints this month: Green = 0, Yellow = 1, Red ≥2.? Roll-up rule: Green if pulse Green and sponsor seen and complaints=0; Yellow if any Yellow and none Red; Red if any Red.Definition of done: One-pager with thresholds + field names published; team can score any account in <2 minutes.Step 2 — Wire collection points & automationsGoal: Capture signals without admin drag; turn Reds into actions.Owner: CS Ops/Admin.Do this:? Add a default 2-question pulse to every strategic meeting template (QBR, budget, roadmap).? Track exec-sponsor heartbeat in CRM (auto-remind at 90/120 days).? Log complaints with root cause in PSA/CS tool (single list, not scattered tickets).? For any CX Red ? auto-create CTA (named owner, checklist, First-Action SLA ≤72h).? Enforce Meeting Quality Checklist on strategic touches: clear purpose, max two decisions, owner/date, recap ≤48h, link to roadmap. Definition of done: Forms/snippets live; automations tested; CTAs appear in red with due-by dates.Step 3 — Review rhythm & watchlist (manage by exception)Goal: Keep attention on risk and momentum, not reports.Owner: CS Lead.Do this:? Weekly CS Ops (30 min): review CX watchlist = accounts with 2+ CX Reds or ≥120 days since exec sponsor seen; confirm CTAs in flight.? Monthly Portfolio (60 min): CX G/Y/R by segment; time-to-first-action trend; root-cause distribution; escalate by segment (A/B ? vCIO review, C/D ? CSM/TAM).? Guardrail: 2 consecutive CX Reds ? expansion credit gated until Yellow/Green returns (QBR notes must show owner/date/budget). Definition of done: Dashboards show time-to-first-action ≤72h median; watchlist cleared or escalated each month.Step 4 — Use CX to tune alignment, cadence, and asksGoal: Make meetings relevant and decisions faster.Owner: vCIO (A/B), CSM/AM (B/C/D), TAM (lifecycle items).Do this:? Start QBRs with a 1-screen Business Outcomes Snapshot (OKRs/risks, last decisions, max two proposed approvals).? If CX flags Relevance ? reframe to “Why this / Why now / Expected impact”; if Follow-through ? tighten recap ≤48h and ownership; if Cadence ? adjust rhythm.? Segment rules of thumb: A = OKR link + exec present; B = roadmap + budget cadence; C = lifecycle + quick wins; D = reliability + clarity. Definition of done: Next-cadence agenda updated; two decisions or clear “no-go with reason” captured in notes.Step 5 — Close the loop (client-visible) & improve the systemGoal: Show you listened; keep templates current.Owner: AM/CSM (client comms), CS Lead (template updates).Do this:? Send a “We heard X / We’ll change Y / You’ll see Z by <date>” note after negative CX.? Update JSP-Lite and playbooks when a theme repeats ≥3 times/quarter (e.g., switch format, resequence asks).? Re-score CX on the next cadence; remove the expansion gate when going back to Yellow/Green. Definition of done: Client acknowledgment logged; template/playbook diff published; CX colour rebounded or escalated.Final Output: A Real-Time, Client-Centric CX Operating ModelYou now have:? Three CX inputs with G/Y/R thresholds and a one-page rulebook.? Automations: CX Red ? CTA with First-Action SLA ≤72h; meeting recap ≤48h; exec sponsor ≤120d heartbeat.? Review rhythm: weekly watchlist + monthly portfolio; 2 consecutive CX Reds ? expansion gate.? Client-visible loop and template updates tied to recurring themes.This keeps CX simple, measurable, and actionable for a 10–150 person MSP—fully aligned with Governance, Enablement, and Compensation.
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?LevelRole of CX Measurement1.1 Technology SupportMay not be measured consistently; feedback is often informal or issue-based (e.g., complaints).1.2 Technology EnablementCX feedback begins to surface via post-meeting CSAT or onboarding reviews.1.3 Technology ModernizationCX metrics gain structure; trends are tied to assessments, usage, and initiative progress.1.4 Business TransformationCX becomes critical, measured across both business and technical interactions.1.5 Business InnovationCX is embedded in OKR reviews and strategic planning; sentiment and stakeholder trust are tracked across departments.How does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Client Business Goal - Customer Experience (CX) becomes increasingly important as the client matures. At lower levels, it reflects the quality of issue resolution; at higher levels, it shapes trust, collaboration, and the innovation potential.? 3. Customer Success Delivery - CX trends inform how reports, proposals, or meetings are received and whether outcomes meet expectations. Poor customer experience (CX) may indicate delivery gaps despite completion.? 4. Customer Success Process - Feedback loops are triggered through post-meeting surveys, Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs), or sentiment check-ins. CX signals can drive service adjustments or engagement escalations.? 6. Customer Success People - Helps evaluate how CSMs, TAMs, vCIOs, and PMs interact with clients. Can support coaching, enablement, or escalation models across roles.? 7. Customer Success Strategy - CX informs segmentation review, SOP adjustments, and roadmap prioritization, ensuring the delivery model remains experience-aligned.Product Links / Tooling SupportThe LMx Client Health score incorporates key CX indicators, including CSAT, NPS, post-meeting feedback, customer sentiment (manually input), relationship with decision-makers, and custom flags (e.g., missed expectations, complaints). These inputs help surface relational risks early and strengthen renewal and upsell potential.

OverviewWhat is the objective?Track whether clients are using what you’ve deployed—so you can prove value, spot gaps, and sequence the next steps. Use a simple, segment-aware Digital Maturity Index (DMI) so every client gets one clear adoption score by category and overall, updated on a fixed cadence (A/B quarterly; C/D semi-annual), and visible in QBRs.Why is it important?? Unused tools create zero business value—even if projects are “completed.”? Adoption is a leading indicator for modernization readiness and retention.? A standard DMI (Green ≥ 80%, Yellow 50–79%, Red <50%) keeps conversations objective across accounts.? Adoption data reduces rework/escalations and builds credibility for roadmap asks.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? See where value is missing after delivery (e.g., MFA deployed but not enrolled).? Prioritize enablement and quick-win remediation before proposing new work.? Gate proposals when foundations aren’t adopted (e.g., MFA <60% = fix first).? Feed DMI into QBR evidence, segmentation reviews, Health triggers, and TAM/CSM scorecards (Compensation).? Keep it compute-light: one DMI sheet, same thresholds, same refresh rhythm.What is the Customer impact?? Clear, shared view of progress and risk; fewer surprises.? Faster ROI: adoption gaps become small, funded initiatives with owners/dates.? Better decisions: budgets and roadmaps tie to measured usage, not opinions.? Trust increases as hygiene improves—opening the door to higher-value projects.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Adoption = business enablement, not deploymentTypical MSP cases solved? Tools are “installed,” but users don’t change behaviour (no MFA, Teams usage, and backups untested).? Projects marked “complete,” yet QBRs show no measurable outcome.? Tickets are down, but execs don’t feel progress.How to apply? Define adoption as “% of users/assets consistently using the capability as intended,” not “installed = yes.”? Track 5–8 “vital” insights that drive outcomes (e.g., MFA, endpoint compliance, backup success, identity hygiene, collaboration use).? Score each insight by % coverage ? weight; show a single Adoption/DMI percentage per account.Practical examples? MFA: users enrolled / total users; Backups: last-30-day success rate; Patch: % endpoints within 14 days; Collaboration: WAU/MAU ratio.? Weights: Security items heavier (e.g., MFA x2).Common pitfalls? Dozens of signals no one maintains.? Treating a one-time rollout as “adopted.”? Counting lab/test users in the denominator.Concept #2: Keep scoring dead simple (DMI = weighted % coverage) and segment-awareTypical MSP cases solved? Binary “yes/no” adoption hides partial rollouts.? Same thresholds for all clients create noise and arguments.How to apply? Use a lightweight DMI: each insight has a weight (1–5). Score = ?(%coverage ? weight) / ?(weight).? Colour rules by segment (example starting point):? Segment C: Green ≥70%, Yellow 55–69%, Red <55%? Segment B: Green ≥80%, Yellow 65–79%, Red <65%? Segment A: Green ≥90%, Yellow 80–89%, Red <80%? Track monthly in one sheet; review quarterly in QBR.Practical examples? Insights (weights): MFA(5), Endpoint compliance(4), Backup success(4), Conditional Access(3), Email security(3), Collaboration usage(2), Device encryption(2).? A C-segment client with 72% DMI = Green; next quarter target = +8 pts.Common pitfalls? Fancy formulas no one can audit.? Constantly changing thresholds mid-year.? “Everything critical” (no weighting).Concept #3: Adoption is the execution feedback loop (Assessment ? Proposal ? DMI move)Typical MSP cases solved? Assessments create long roadmaps, but DMI doesn’t budge.? Expansion credited before adoption proves value.How to apply? For every approved initiative, define the adoption move you expect (e.g., MFA +30 pts, Endpoint +20 pts).? Use the QBR credit gate: expansion/roadmap credit counts only when QBR notes show decision + owner + date + budget, and the related adoption insight improves by the following review.? If adoption stalls, trigger a remediation play before proposing new projects.Practical examples? “MFA rollout” target: enroll 90% users in 60 days; DMI security block moves from 52% ? 82%.? QBR slide: “What we changed / DMI before-after / next adoption move.”Common pitfalls? Crediting “intent” without measured change.? Proposing tier-2 tools while tier-1 adoption is still Red.? No owner for post-project adoption follow-through.Concept #4: Clear role ownership and a light cadence (TAM gathers, CSM validates, vCIO frames)Typical MSP cases solved? TAMs collect data ad hoc; CSMs don’t know what “good” looks like; vCIOs present without context.? Adoption scoring drifts because no one owns updates.How to apply? TAM: owns data capture and updates insights monthly from PSA/RMM/M365/backup.? CSM/AM: confirms initiative status matches the DMI move; logs blockers; preps QBR talking points.? vCIO: connects adoption to business outcomes and budget; sequences next moves.? Cadence: A/B quarterly updates, C/D semi-annual (monthly for high-risk Reds).Practical examples? Source-of-truth map: RMM for patch %, M365 portal for MFA/CA, backup console for success rate.? 20-minute monthly “Adoption huddle”: top 5 deltas, owners, due-by dates.Common pitfalls? “Everyone” owns it (so no one does).? Hunting across tools with no field naming standard.? Quarterly surprises because monthly checks didn’t happen.Concept #5: Adoption Scores Are a Core Input for CS Health and Strategic ForecastingTypical MSP cases solved? Dashboards turn Red and nothing happens.? Teams debate numbers instead of acting.How to apply? Stand up four core automation-first triggers (plus two optional):1. MFA below target ? Owner: TAM · Due: 5 days · Play: enroll laggards + exec note2. Endpoint compliance < target ? TAM · 5 days · Play: patch policy fix + recheck3. Backup success <95% (rolling 30) ? TAM · 3 days · Play: root cause + test restore4. Adoption flat 2 cycles ? CSM · 7 days · Play: value reset + quick win Optional: A new system was delivered, but the DMI was unchanged. ? CSM; Stakeholder change ? CSM intro.? Add a “First Action SLA ≤72h” widget.Practical examples? Email snippet library: exec-friendly notes for MFA/backup gaps.? QBR metric: “Time-to-first-action on adoption Reds” (target ≤72h).Common pitfalls? Assigning to a team instead of a named owner.? No due-by window or checklist.? Too many triggers ? alert fatigue.Concept #6: Use DMI to drive sequencing, forecasting, and pricing hygieneTypical MSP cases solved? Roadmaps jump to advanced items while basics lag.? Renewals surprise you because adoption never stuck.? Over-servicing low-adoption clients kills margin.How to apply? Sequencing gate: don’t push tier-2 initiatives until tier-1 adoption is Green.? Forecasting: combine Adoption (DMI trend) + Engagement + CX to grade renewal confidence.? Pricing: if DMI remains low after agreed plays, right-size service level or price to fit reality.? Compensation fit: The TAM variable includes the adoption/DMI delta; the AM/CSM expansion credit is gated by adoption readiness (see Compensation blueprint).Practical examples? Portfolio board: “Adoption vs. Proposal Success Rate” by segment.? Segment move: C?B when DMI ≥75% and engagement is Strong for 2 quarters.Common pitfalls? Selling the roadmap you wish they’d adopt vs. the one they’re ready for.? Ignoring margin leakage on chronic low-adoption accounts.? Treating DMI as a vanity metric (no actions tied).
Implementation ProcessStep 1 — Stand up the DMI sheet (one afternoon)Owner: CS Ops (or TAM if Ops-lite)Goal: One place to score adoption the same way for every client.Do this? Create a single spreadsheet with tabs:? Threshold Library: Green ≥ 80%, Yellow 50–79%, Red <50%; segment targets (A/B quarterly refresh; C/D semi-annual).? Categories: Security, Productivity/Collab, Backup/DR, Identity/Access, Endpoint/Lifecycle (adjust to your stack).? Insights: 2–5 per category (e.g., MFA enrollment %, EDR coverage %, patch compliance %, backup test ≤90 days, Teams MAU %).? Formula: Insight score = weight ? compliance % ? DMI = (? earned / ? weights) ? 100.? Account Summary: one row per client: Current DMI, ? vs last, Top-3 gaps, following actions.? Preload gates you’ll reuse everywhere: MFA <60% or Endpoint protection <80% ? remediation before any new initiative.Definition of done? The sheet calculates DMI per account using colours.? Every insight has a plain-English definition and data source.Step 2 — Baseline every client (timebox, don’t boil the ocean)Owner: TAM (data) + CSM (initiative linkage) + vCIO (business impact notes)Goal: A first pass that’s “accurate enough” to act.Do this? Pull quick exports (PSA/EDR/AV/Backup/M365) and enter coverage % per insight.? For each account, list the top-3 gaps and write one sentence on business risk.? Add one quick win per gap (owner/date). Keep it small and fundable.Definition of done? 100% accounts have a DMI baseline and Top-3 gaps.? Each account has at least one quick win with the owner/date.Step 3 — Wire cadence & triggers (turn drops into tasks)Owner: CS Ops (rules) + role owners (execution)Goal: Health-style automation so adoption gaps create work, not debates.Do this? Refresh rhythm: A/B quarterly, C/D semi-annual (put dates in the sheet).? Auto-CTAs (First-Action SLA ≤ 72h):? MFA <60% ? Owner: TAM · Due: 14 days · Play: 3-step remediation + 15-min ops sync.? Endpoint/EDR <80% ? Owner: TAM · Due: 14 days · Play: coverage push + exceptions log.? DMI drop ≥10 pts or flat two cycles ? Owner: vCIO/CSM · Due: 7 days · Play: resequence roadmap; add quick wins.? Add a small dashboard widget: “DMI CTAs open / Time-to-first-action.”Definition of done? Triggers create CTAs with named owners and due dates automatically.? Average time-to-first-action on adoption CTAs ≤ 72h.Step 4 — Make DMI the QBR evidence (two slides, two asks)Owner: CSM (pack), TAM (numbers), vCIO (story)Goal: Use DMI to justify pace and budget—without a slide parade.Do this? Put two slides in every QBR:1. DMI Trend (last ? now) with Top-3 gaps2. Proposed approvals (max 2) ? “Why this / Why now / Expected impact”? Apply your credit gate: an approval only counts when the owner + date + budget are in the QBR notes.? Gate proposals if foundations aren’t adopted (e.g., MFA <60% / Endpoint <80% ? fix first).Definition of done? QBRs show DMI trend + two asks; decisions are logged with owner/date/budget (counts for Comp & Governance).Step 5 — Use DMI in planning, segmentation, and forecastingOwner: CS Lead + Finance (quarterly)Goal: Let adoption shape where time and money go.Do this? Forecasting: Low DMI + low Engagement = high risk; flag in renewal board.? Segmentation: Move C ? B when DMI sustains ≥70% and cadence holds; move B ? C if DMI regresses and CTAs age out.? Capacity: Prioritize TAM time on Red/Yellow insights that unblock the roadmap.? Comp tie-in: TAM variable uses Adoption/DMI delta; AM/CSM use health guardrails (expansion gated until Yellow/Green).Definition of done? A quarterly note records any segment changes and the DMI evidence.? Renewal forecast includes an “Adoption risk” column.Step 6 — Keep the framework light and accurateOwner: CS Ops (quarterly), CS Lead (approve)Goal: Improve quality without adding complexity.Do this? Review weights and retire/add insights (max 20 total across categories).? Spot-check 5 accounts: does evidence match the score?? Update playbooks where the same gap keeps reappearing.Definition of done? Sheet refresh takes <30 minutes/account.? No more than two insight changes per quarter (stability over churn).Starter kit (ship these with the plan)? DMI Spreadsheet v1 (tabs: Thresholds, Categories, Insights, Accounts).? The trigger list (+ owners & due-by) is ready to paste into the PSA/CS tool.? QBR mini-pack (2 slides + decision log block).? One-page “Fix-first” gates (MFA <60%, Endpoint <80%).? How-to: where each number comes from (data links/fields).
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?LevelRole of Technology Adoption1.1 Technology SupportDMI is typically low; tools may be deployed but not used consistently.1.2 Technology EnablementDMI rises as core systems gain usage; adoption gaps are surfaced.1.3 Technology ModernizationDMI becomes a core input for the roadmap and stack standardization.1.4 Business TransformationDMI drives improvement planning and prioritizes transformation efforts.1.5 Business InnovationDMI supports cross-departmental tech optimization and innovation readiness, including AI, automation, and business intelligence (BI).How does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Client Business Goal - Technology Adoption, via DMI, becomes the clearest signal of readiness to move up the CS maturity curve. It converts asset and stack insights into business-aligned decision support.? 3. Customer Success Delivery - DMI results feed into assessment reports, platform utilization metrics, and roadmap proposals. High or low scores inform CS focus areas.? 4. Customer Success Process - The DMI informs intake processes and roadmap planning. Sudden dips or improvement plateaus can trigger initiatives, playbooks, or training workflows.? 6. Customer Success People - TAMs, CSMs, and vCIOs use DMI to drive engagement agendas, segment reviews, and stakeholder coaching. It supports quarterly or annual planning sessions with structured input and feedback.? 7. Customer Success Strategy - Adoption and DMI trends guide segmentation, capacity planning, and service mix development. They ensure that the CS strategy is tied to measurable client outcomes, rather than anecdotal perceptions.Product Links / Tooling SupportThe LMx Digital Maturity Index (DMI) is the key metric that quantifies technology adoption and maturity. It aggregates compliance across insights (e.g., patching, EOL coverage, identity protection), weighted by severity and adoption gaps. DMI supports both negative scoring and weighted average strategies, allowing it to reflect progress at the organizational, client, or global level.Inputs may include M365 usage, backup status, stack alignment ratios, endpoint compliance, and other relevant metrics. A rising DMI score indicates growing maturity; a stagnant or declining score highlights the adoption risk.

OverviewWhat is the objective?To measure and manage how clients show up in the CS rhythm—not by gut feel, but through a few observable signals:? Cadence adherence: planned meetings happen on time.? Stakeholder mix: the right people attend (incl. an exec sponsor seen ≤120 days).? Decision velocity: proposals/initiatives move (max two decisions per QBR, logged with owner/date/budget).? Follow-through: recap ≤48h and actions closed on time. Roll these into a monthly Green/Yellow/Red per account and use them to trigger the right playbooks.Why is it important?? Engagement enables influence. Low engagement = slow/no approvals, stalled Adoption/DMI, weak outcomes.? Early risk signal. Drops in engagement typically precede CX dips and renewal surprises.? Fewer wasted cycles. Keeps meetings relevant, short, and decision-oriented (no slide parades).? Clean handoffs. AM/CSM ? TAM ? vCIO stay in sync because the rhythm is visible and scored.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Prioritize time: Focus AM/CSM and vCIO on accounts where engagement + impact justify it.? Gate proposals wisely: If engagement = Red for 2 months, gate expansion credit until Yellow/Green returns (ties to Compensation).? Trigger actions, not debates: Any engagement drop auto-creates a CTA (first-action SLA ≤72h) with the matching play.? Forecast better: Engagement + Adoption + CX = a simple, accurate renewal confidence view.? Align segments: Expectations differ by segment (A/B strategic cadence, C lifecycle hygiene, D reliability); the score reflects that.What is the Customer impact?? Faster, clearer decisions: Two well-framed asks per QBR; next steps are owned and dated.? Less meeting fatigue: Right people, right cadence, short agenda, recap ≤48h.? Visible progress: Clients see momentum in roadmaps and quick wins, not just activity.? More trust: A predictable rhythm that respects time and ties every touchpoint to outcomes.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Engagement = observable behaviour, not “interest”Typical MSP cases solved? “They like us,” but skip QBRs and don’t approve initiatives.? Long email threads, zero decisions.? In opt-only meetings, the decision-maker is never in the room.How to apply? Measure behaviour you can see: Cadence Adherence, Stakeholder Mix, Decision Velocity, Follow-up Closure.? Score Engagement monthly; pay attention to trends, not one-off spikes.? Treat engagement as a gate for expansion and roadmap pacing.Practical examples? Cadence Adherence = completed/planned meetings.? Stakeholder Mix = % sessions with a decision-maker present.? Decision Velocity = median days from proposal to yes/no.? Follow-up Closure = % meeting recaps sent ≤48h and action items accepted.Common pitfalls? Confusing “responsiveness” with engagement.? Counting any meeting as equal (ops-only ≠ strategic).? No decision timestamps ? can’t measure velocity.Concept #2: Keep scoring dead simple (4 signals ? one colour)Typical MSP cases solved? Gut-feel debates: “I think they’re engaged.”? Complex rubrics no one updates.How to apply? Engagement Score (0–100) = 30% Cadence Adherence · 30% Stakeholder Mix · 25% Decision Velocity · 15% Follow-up Closure.? Convert to G/Y/R by segment (starting points):? C: Green ≥70, Yellow 55–69, Red <55? B: Green ≥75, Yellow 60–74, Red <60? A: Green ≥80, Yellow 70–79, Red <70? Track monthly; review in QBR prep.Practical examples? If a B account hits: Cadence 90, Mix 70, Velocity 65, Closure 80 ? Score = 0.3·90 + 0.3·70 + 0.25·65 + 0.15·80 = 77.25 ? Green.Common pitfalls? Changing weights mid-year.? Using 10+ inputs (noise).? Ignoring segment context.Concept #3: Segment-aware expectations (D?A)Typical MSP cases solved? Expecting A-level executive engagement from D/C clients.? Over-servicing low-maturity accounts with heavy workshops.How to apply? D: short ops check-ins; prove reliability.? C: quarterly lifecycle/QBR; get sign-offs on quick wins.? B: roadmap reviews, multi-stakeholder planning; push approvals.? A: exec-level sessions tied to OKRs; co-owned roadmap & budget.? Use the same four signals, but raise the thresholds as you move up segments.Practical examples? C segment: target Stakeholder Mix ≥50% with a budget owner present at least every other QBR.? A segment: Decision Velocity target ≤30 days on approved items.Common pitfalls? One flat standard for all clients.? Mistaking friendly ops chats for strategic engagement.Concept #4: Triggers create tasks (Health ? Playbooks), not meetingsTypical MSP cases solved? “We’ll discuss it next week,” while momentum dies.? It is a red engagement but has no owner and no due date.How to apply? Stand up four automation-first triggers (plus two optional). Each opens a CTA with owner + due-by + checklist:1. Missed cadence twice ? Owner: CSM · Due: 72h · Play: 2-line value recap ? propose 30-min reset ? add exec.2. No decision ≥30 days on proposal ? Owner: AM/CSM · Due: 72h · Play: decision brief + options (approve/adjust/park).3. Decision-maker absent two sessions ? Owner: CSM · Due: 5d · Play: sponsor re-intro + “why now” note.4. Follow-ups not closed in 48h twice ? Owner: CSM · Due: 72h · Play: fast recap + confirm next steps. Optional: stakeholder change (new exec), repeated agenda “no value” feedback.Practical examples? Dashboard widget: “Time-to-first-action on Engagement Reds” (target ≤72h).? Snippet library for exec outreach.Common pitfalls? Assigning to a team instead of a named person.? No due-by windows; CTAs age out.? Trigger overload (keep it to 4–6).Concept #5: Engagement Scoring Strengthens Forecasting, Planning, and PrioritizationTypical MSP cases solved? Deals pushed into disengaged accounts ? slow/no adoption, future churn.? Internal fights over what “counts.”How to apply? If Engagement = Red for 2+ months, expansion from that account does not count toward NRR that quarter (credit returns when Engagement ≥ Yellow and a QBR resets next steps).? Use the “credit gate” in Compensation for AM/CSM; keep vCIO advisory neutral.Practical examples? QBR slide: “Engagement status ? credit status” per account.? The AM plan shows gated vs. eligible expansion.Common pitfalls? Overriding the gate with exceptions.? Paying for proposals sent, not decisions made.Concept #6: Use Engagement to prioritize time, forecast renewals, and set rhythmTypical MSP cases solved? Team spends hours on low-engagement, low-value accounts.? Renewal surprises because engagement decayed months earlier.How to apply? Prioritization: Focus vCIO/AM time on High Adoption + High Engagement first; deploy re-engagement plays on Low Engagement before pitching.? Forecasting: Renewal confidence = blend of Engagement colour + DMI trend + CX.? Rhythm: If Engagement Red, shorten meeting scope and increase frequency briefly; once Yellow/Green, widen scope again.Practical examples? The segment board combines engagement colour with DMI and CX to rank the QBR prep order.? Playbook: “Disengaged B account” = reduce agenda to one decision + one quick win.Common pitfalls? Proposing complex initiatives for Red engagement.? Treating Engagement as “nice to have” vs. the execution gate.Concept #7: Roles & hygiene make or break engagement qualityTypical MSP cases solved? Meetings drift tactical; execs stop showing up.? Next steps unclear; nothing moves.How to apply? CSM/AM: owns cadence, recap ≤48h, decision tracking.? vCIO (A/B): anchors strategic narrative, ties to OKRs/budget, keeps max two decisions per session.? TAM: brings adoption/quality facts and quick wins.? Use a one-page meeting checklist: agenda, who the decision-maker is, desired decisions, recap deadline, and owner/date.Practical examples? JSP-Lite format: Health snapshot ? Roadmap progress ? 1–2 approvals with owner/date/budget.? A monthly 20-minute “Engagement huddle” will be held to review deltas and stuck items.Common pitfalls? Slide parades without decisions.? Recaps that restate minutes but lack owners/dates.
Implementation ProcessStep 1 — Set segment expectations & ownersGoal: Make “good engagement” explicit by segment.Owner: CS Lead (input from AM/CSM, TAM, vCIO).Do this:? Publish a 1-pager with segment baselines:? A: exec sponsor present ≤120 days; quarterly strategy; 1–2 decisions per QBR.? B: roadmap cadence; approvers present; 1–2 decisions per QBR.? C: lifecycle reviews; initiative sign-offs; keep cadence.? D: operational check-ins; reliability updates.? Map who owns what: AM/CSM = cadence & decisions, TAM = lifecycle inputs, vCIO = exec relevance.Definition of done: The 1-pager is posted; each item has an A (Accountable) role that also appears on that role’s scorecard (Compensation link).Step 2 — Instrument the four signalsGoal: Capture observable engagement data every time, no opinions.Owner: CS Ops (or CS Lead if Ops-lite).Do this (copy/paste):? Cadence adherence: % planned meetings held on time from the calendar/CS tool/PSA.? Stakeholder mix: flag exec sponsor seen ≤120 days (Y/N) in CRM.? Decision velocity: per QBR, max two decisions, each logged with owner/date/budget.? Follow-through: recap ≤48h with actions recorded.? Add a 5-point Meeting Quality Checklist to every strategic touchpoint (purpose, ≤2 decisions, owner/date, recap ≤48h, roadmap link).Definition of done: A simple data map shows where each signal lives (Calendar/CS tool/PSA/CRM/Docs) and who updates it.Step 3 — Score monthly (G/Y/R) & auto-trigger playsGoal: One colour per account; rules everyone understands.Owner: CS Ops sets rules; AM/CSM execute.Do this:? Green if: cadence ≥90% and exec seen ≤120d and recap ≤48h ≥95% and ≥70% QBRs have ≥1 decision.? Yellow if: any one metric slips (cadence 80–89%, recap 80–94%, no exec ≤120d, or decisions <70%).? Red if: cadence <80% or no exec >120d or recap <80% or zero decisions in last 2 QBRs or a complaint tagged “Relevance/Follow-through”.? Automation: Any Red ? create CTA with first-action SLA ≤72h and prefilled play:? “Re-engage Stakeholders” (CSM, 72h)? “Reset Cadence & Scope” (CSM, 72h)? “Exec Intro + Value Recap” (AM/CSM, 10 days)? “Unblock/Resequence Roadmap” (vCIO, 7 days) Definition of done: Portfolio dashboard shows colour per account + time-to-first-action for Reds.Step 4 — Run the lightweight review rhythmGoal: Keep momentum without meeting bloat.Owner: CS Lead runs; team participates.? Weekly AM/CSM (30 min): next 14 days of QBRs; confirm two asks, assets, owners; check open CTAs from engagement Reds.? Weekly CS Ops (20 min): data freshness, trigger audits, field corrections.? Monthly Segment Review (60 min): heatmap (Engagement G/Y/R, Adoption/DMI, CX); reassign owners; launch/close micro-campaigns.Definition of done: Meetings on calendar, action log shows owners/dates; aging CTAs decrease month over month.Step 5 — Gate proposals & align with CompensationGoal: Stop pushing projects into low-engagement accounts.Owner: AM/CSM (with vCIO for A/B).Do this:? Expansion gate: 2 consecutive Engagement Reds ? expansion credit is paused until Yellow/Green returns (ties to Compensation guardrail).? Allow urgent risk-reduction items (e.g., MFA) but log them as stability work, not portfolio growth.Definition of done: Calculator/plan notes the gate; disputed credits reference the QBR decision log.Step 6 — Coach the basics, fix the templatesGoal: Improve the system where it actually broke.Owner: CS Lead + Enablement.Do this:? If recap ≤48h <95% ? train on the recap template; add checklist to the meeting note.? If exec seen >120d ? run the Exec Intro play (AM/CSM), involve vCIO in A/B.? If “repetitive meetings” appear≥3? in a quarter ? switch to JSP-Lite + two-decision format for that segment.Definition of done: Next month’s KPI improves (recap rate, exec heartbeat, decision %).Step 7 — Publish the Starter KitGoal: Make it self-serve for a 1–5 person CS team.Owner: CS Lead.Pack contents:? Segment expectations one-pager (A/B/C/D).? Meeting Quality Checklist + recap ≤48h template.? Engagement scoring rules (G/Y/R) + automation triggers (≤72h first action).? Three re-engagement plays (checklists + email snippets).? Dashboard how-to (which fields, where).Definition of done: New hires can run the system in one sitting.Copy/Paste thresholds (keep consistent across blueprints)? Recap ≤48h, first-action ≤72h, exec sponsor seen ≤120 days, max two decisions per QBR.? Green: cadence ≥90%, recap ≥95%, exec seen ≤120d, decisions ≥70%.? Yellow: anyone slips.? Red: cadence <80% or recap <80% or no exec >120d or zero decisions in last 2 QBRs or complaint tag (Relevance/Follow-through/Quality).? Guardrail: 2 consecutive Reds ? expansion credit gate until Yellow/Green returns.Minimal data map (one source per signal)? Cadence adherence: Calendar/CS tool/PSA meeting records.? Stakeholder mix/exec heartbeat: CRM contact roles + last-seen date.? Decision velocity: QBR Decision Log (owner/date/budget).? Follow-through: Docs/CS tool/PSA note with timestamp; dashboard widget: “Recap ≤48h”.30-60-90 quick rollout? Days 1–30: Publish segment 1-pager + checklist; turn on recap ≤48h tracking; colour 10–20 accounts.? Days 31–60: Automate Red?CTA with ≤72h SLA; start weekly AM/CSM + CS Ops.? Days 61–90: Enforce expansion gate; add dashboard widgets; run enablement where a KPI is below target.This keeps Engagement simple, visible, and actionable—and fully aligned with CX, Governance, and Compensation.
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?LevelRole of Engagement1.1 Technology SupportSporadic or issue-based contact; meetings are rare or reactive.1.2 Technology EnablementEngagement becomes more regular, with reviews conducted monthly or quarterly.1.3 Technology ModernizationA meeting cadence is established, including a roadmap and initiative tracking.1.4 Business TransformationEngagement expands to include more departments and outcome reviews.1.5 Business InnovationStrategic engagement is continuous and multilevel, aligned with OKRs and innovation cycles.How does it connect to the other parts?1. Client Business Goal - The level and type of engagement reflect client maturity. As goals shift from support to innovation, engagement evolves from reactive troubleshooting to proactive co-planning and alignment.3. Customer Success Delivery - Engagement is the gateway to delivering reports, roadmaps, and strategies. Missed meetings or a lack of stakeholder participation reduce delivery effectiveness and perceived value.4. Customer Success Process - Engagement is tied to scheduling, meeting execution, and intake processes. It also informs initiative tracking and follow-up task management.6. Customer Success People - Tied closely to Account Managers, vCIOs, CSMs, and other client-facing roles. Low engagement can indicate role misalignment or missed handoffs. High engagement supports coaching and prioritization.7. Customer Success Strategy - Engagement metrics inform segmentation, cadence planning, and SOP performance. Strategy also adapts when engagement quality impacts delivery consistency or roadmap velocity.Product Links / Tooling SupportThe LMx Client Health score may reflect engagement indicators, including the number of meetings held, meeting frequency compared to the target cadence, stakeholder attendance, action item completion, and executive relationship tracking. These inputs help assess whether the relationship is growing, stagnating, or declining.

OverviewWhat is the objective?To measure and improve the reliability of day-to-day delivery across tickets, projects, and initiatives using a short, repeatable set of signals:? SLA adherence (response + resolution)? Milestone delivery (projects/initiatives on time)? Recurrence & root cause (repeat incidents closed with RCA)? Client-facing follow-through (recap ≤48h after strategic meetings)? First action on quality CTAs (≤72h) when thresholds are missed Score accounts monthly (G/Y/R) and trigger simple playbooks when quality slips.Why is it important?? Trust foundation: strategy stalls if basics wobble; quality keeps QBRs credible.? Early risk signal: missed SLAs or late milestones flag churn/renewal risk sooner than sentiment.? Margin protection: fewer escalations/rework; clearer ownership and handoffs.? Portfolio velocity: consistent quality makes approvals and adoption move faster.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? One truth, low effort: pull SLA/milestones from PSA; recap timestamps from docs/PSA; roll up in a single Health widget.? Auto-action, not debate: any Red opens a CTA with first-action ≤72h (e.g., TAM “Root Cause + Client Comms” due in 5 days).? Segment-aware:? D: response/resolution consistency? C: lifecycle visibility + error remediation? B: initiative execution + cadence alignment? A: project performance + outcome transparency? Aligned with Compensation: TAM/CSM quality trends feed scorecards (no activity pay, outcome proof via QBR).? Fits small teams: a handful of metrics, one monthly colour, one quarterly review.What is the Customer impact?? Fewer surprises, faster recovery: clear updates and predictable timelines.? Higher confidence to approve work: reliable execution ? easier decisions in QBRs.? Better outcomes: less firefighting, more time for adoption and modernization.? Stronger trust: professional follow-through (recap ≤48h) and visible root-cause fixes.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Quality = reliability the client can feel (not just speed)Typical MSP cases solved? “We hit response SLAs, but they still complain.”? Tickets close fast, then re-open; projects slip quietly.? Status updates are late or opaque, so trust erodes.How to apply? Define quality as: SLA reliability + low recurrence + on-time initiatives + professional follow-through.? Make this the first slide in QBRs before roadmap approvals.Practical examples? Include “no surprises” checks: ETA given, progress updates during incidents, recap with owners/dates.? Track re-opened tickets within 30 days as a quality proxy.Common pitfalls? Treating CSAT alone as “quality”.? Optimizing first response while ignoring resolution, recurrence, or communication.Concept #2: Keep scoring dead simple (4 signals ? one colour)Typical MSP cases solved? Endless debates about “Is quality good?”? Complex QA rubrics no one updates.How to apply Use four signals ? 0–100 score ? G/Y/R by segment:? SLA Compliance Trend (30%) – response + resolution vs target (last 30/90 days).? On-Time Delivery (25%) – % milestones met for projects/initiatives.? Recurrence/Reopen (25%) – % tickets re-opened or repeated issue within 30 days (lower is better).? Follow-Through (20%) – % client-facing meetings with recap ≤48h and action acceptance. G/Y/R thresholds (starting points): D ≥70/55–69/<55 · C ≥75/60–74/<60 · B ≥80/70–79/<70 · A ≥85/75–84/<75.Practical examples? B account: SLA 88, On-Time 72, Recurrence 80, Follow-Through 90 ? 0.3·88 + 0.25·72 + 0.25·80 + 0.2·90 = 82.1 (Green).Common pitfalls? Changing weights mid-year.? Adding >6 inputs (noise).? No agreed source of truth (PSA/initiative tracker).Concept #3: Segment-aware standards (D?A)Typical MSP cases solved? Holding D/C accounts to A-level project rigour.? Over-engineering reports for small clients.How to apply? D: Prioritize stable response/resolution and clear comms.? C: add lifecycle hygiene and visible remediation of recurrent issues.? B: emphasize on-time initiative delivery; publish milestone plans.? A: executive-ready change control, risk logs, and RCA discipline.Practical examples? C: monthly “Top 5 recurring issues” with fixes and owners.? A: “Change window + rollback plan” required for high-impact work.Common pitfalls? One flat bar for all segments.? Fancy dashboards without basic reliability.Concept #4: Triggers create tasks (Health ? Playbooks), not meetingsTypical MSP cases solved? Quality turns Red, and nothing happens except a longer agenda.? Escalations repeat because no one owns the root cause.How to apply Stand up four automation-first triggers (plus two optional). Each opens a CTA with owner + due-by + checklist:1. SLA trend Red 2 weeks ? Owner: TAM · Due: 5 days ? Play: root-cause + client comms + prevention plan.2. Milestone slip >14 days ? Owner: vCIO/Lead · Due: 72h ? Play: resequence + new ETA + risk note to client.3. Reopen rate >8% (30d) ? Owner: TAM · Due: 10 days ? Play: eliminate top 2 repeaters; verify in QBR notes.4. Follow-through <80% (last 60d) ? Owner: CSM · Due: 72h ? Play: recap discipline reset + template coaching. Optional: High-priority incident (P1) ? exec update template; Change fail ? post-mortem within five biz days.Practical examples? Dashboard widget: “Time-to-first-action on Quality Reds” (target ≤72h).? Snippet library for P1 comms (initial/update/close).Common pitfalls? Assigning to a team, not a person.? No due-by window; CTAs age out.? Trigger bloat (>6 rules).Concept #5:  Quality is a dependency for strategy (gate big approvals)Typical MSP cases solved? Pushing modernization while tickets burn.? Selling new work that later stalls due to shaky delivery.How to apply? If Service Quality = Red for 2+ months, pause new initiatives >$X unless a risk plan is agreed in QBR (owner/date/budget).? Start every QBR with the Quality snapshot; approve the roadmap only after risks have owners.Practical examples? QBR section: “Quality gates ? Approved/Deferred” with rationale.? Small “quick wins” were allowed during Red to rebuild trust.Common pitfalls? Waiving the gate with one-off exceptions.? Hiding slips until quarter-end.Concept #6: Tie ownership to roles you already haveTypical MSP cases solved? Quality “belongs to support,” CS just reports it.? vCIO gets dragged into ticket triage.How to apply? TAM: SLA trend, recurrence removal, lifecycle hygiene.? CSM/AM: follow-through discipline, client comms, expectation setting.? vCIO (A/B): milestone risk management, change control, escalation path.? Keep a one-page Quality RACI by segment inside playbooks and review quarterly.Practical examples? TAM monthly: “Top 5 fixes delivered” slide.? vCIO: “Next 30-day risk & mitigation” panel in A/B QBRs.Common pitfalls? Blurry ownership (“everyone helps”).? Pushing all updates via email, no CS tool/PSA/record.Concept #7: Make RCA a habit (small, fast, useful)Typical MSP cases solved? The same outages happen again.? Post-mortems are too heavy for a small team, so none happen.How to apply? 5-Why mini-RCA template, ≤15 minutes, within five biz days; log fix + prevention in CS tool/PSA and summarize in QBR notes.? Track “RCA on time %” as a Quality sub-metric.Practical examples? Two-column note: “What happened / What we changed.”? Share the top 3 RCAs across clients if applicable.Common pitfalls? Novel-length RCAs no one reads.? Fix shipped, but no validation (issue returns).
Implementation ProcessStep 1 — Pick your four core signals and set segment thresholdsGoal: Define “quality” in plain terms that you can score monthly.Owner: CS Lead with Service Manager (or TAM Lead).Do this? Choose four core signals (keep it tight):? SLA adherence (response + resolution)? Milestone on-time % (projects/initiatives)? Repeat-ticket rate (same category within 30 days)? Meeting recap ≤48h rate (strategic meetings/QBRs) Optional #5: First action on quality CTAs ≤72h (execution discipline)? Set G/Y/R by segment (start points you can tune):? D: SLA ≥90% (G) · Milestones n/a or ≥75% · Repeat ≤15% · Recap ≥90%? C: SLA ≥92% · Milestones ≥80% · Repeat ≤10% · Recap ≥92%? B: SLA ≥95% · Milestones ≥85% · Repeat ≤8% · Recap ≥95%? A: SLA ≥97% · Milestones ≥90% · Repeat ≤5% · Recap ≥95%Definition of done: One page with signals, segment thresholds, and colour rules.Step 2 — Wire data to a single monthly score (one source of truth)Goal: Make scoring a 30-minute job, not archaeology.Owner: CS Ops (or CS Lead + Finance if Ops is light).Do this? Map sources: PSA (SLA, milestones, repeats), Docs/PSA (recap timestamps), CS tool (CTAs).? Pick a snapshot day (e.g., last business day). Export ? paste into a Quality Sheet:? Account tab: raw metrics + auto G/Y/R per signal? Summary tab: %Green/Yellow/Red by segment + trendsDefinition of done: Anyone can produce the monthly colour in <30 minutes.Step 3 — Automate 4 quality triggers ? playbooks (alerts create tasks)Goal: Turn dips into action, not debate.Owner: CS Ops (rules) + Role owners (execution).Do this? Stand up these automation-first triggers (each creates a CTA with owner + due date):1. SLA Red (this month) ? TAM “Root Cause + Client Comms” · Due: 5 days2. Milestone late >14 days ? PM/TAM “Resequence + Risk Note” · Due: 3 days3. Repeat-ticket spike (>threshold) ? TAM “Problem Mgmt mini-RCA” · Due: 7 days4. Recap ≤48h violation (<target) ? CSM “Recap Discipline Reset” · Due: 72h? Add a guardrail: 2 consecutive Quality Reds on an account ? vCIO reviews roadmap; limit new asks until back to Yellow.Definition of done: New CTAs appear automatically; first-action SLA ≤72h is visible on the dashboard.Step 4 — Run the rhythm (weekly huddle, monthly roll-up, quarterly review)Goal: Keep momentum without meeting bloat.Owner: CS Lead.Do this? Weekly Quality Huddle (20 min): top deltas, CTAs aging, unblock owners.? Monthly Portfolio (60 min): score G/Y/R per account, aim for ≥80% Green; note systemic themes.? Quarterly: fold Quality trends into QBR prep and Compensation calibration (TAM/CSM quality components).Definition of done: Meetings on calendar; aging CTAs decrease month over month.Step 5 — Close the loop: mini-RCA + client-visible fixGoal: Convert fixes into trust.Owner: CTA owner (TAM/PM/CSM) + vCIO for A/B accounts.Do this? Use a 1-page mini-RCA: What happened / Why / Fix / Prevent / Owner & date.? Send a client note (plain English) and log it to QBR notes.? Verify on next cadence; mark “Verified” when the metric rebounds.Definition of done: RCA is attached to CTA; verified within one cadence cycle.Step 6 — Evidence quality in QBRs (and gate big asks)Goal: Keep QBRs credible and outcome-led.Owner: CSM (prep) + vCIO (A/B).Do this? Add a 1-screen Quality Snapshot to every QBR: last 90 days SLA, milestones, repeats, recap rate, and CTAs closed.? Tie 1–2 roadmap asks “Why now” and the quality trajectory.? If Quality = Red this quarter, lead with the fix plan; keep max two decisions.Definition of done: Expansion/roadmap credit only when decisions have owner + date + budget (credit gate) and quality risk is addressed.Step 7 — Calibrate and coach (lightweight, predictable)Goal: Improve the system without adding bureaucracy.Owner: CS Lead + Service Manager.Do this? Monthly: coach from themes (e.g., recap discipline, handoff gaps).? Quarterly: adjust thresholds once if needed; update playbooks; share 10-minute Loom on what changed.? Feed systemic issues to Process/Governance (SOP tweaks) and align weights with Compensation.Definition of done: Updated thresholds/playbooks published; next quarter calendar set.Final Output: Service Quality Starter Kit? Signals & Thresholds one-pager (by segment)? Quality Sheet (Account + Summary tabs) with auto G/Y/R? 4 Triggered Playbooks (owners, due-bys, checklists)? Mini-RCA template + client note snippet? Meeting rhythm (agenda for Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly) This keeps quality measurement small, visible, and actionable—so strategy rides on a stable base and clients feel the improvement quickly.
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?LevelRole of Service Quality1.1 Technology SupportThe primary success metric is proof that “things are working” and SLAs are met.1.2 Technology EnablementStill heavily operational, but quality signals readiness for deeper projects.1.3 Technology ModernizationQuality ensures the stable execution of modernization initiatives.1.4 Business TransformationEnables trust in productivity and transformation outcomes.1.5 Business InnovationQuality is assumed; any disruption undermines the credibility of strategic partnerships.How does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Client Business Goal - Quality delivery underpins every goal level. At lower levels, it enables stability; at higher levels, it becomes invisible but critical infrastructure for strategic progress.? 3. Customer Success Delivery - Delivery consistency is tied directly to ticket metrics, SLA dashboards, incident logs, and QBR outputs. Quality influences whether the MSP is perceived as reliable.? 4. Customer Success Process - Closely linked to SOPs, execution frameworks, and verification procedures. Triggers escalation or feedback loops when KPIs or SLAs are not met.? 6. Customer Success People - Relies on the performance of helpdesk, field techs, TAMs, and service managers. Quality gaps can reflect issues in enablement, process adoption, or bandwidth.? 7. Customer Success Strategy - Segmented service models depend on quality consistency to scale. Strategy also evaluates whether quality variation correlates with segment, industry, or CS model.Product Links / Tooling SupportThe LMx Client Health score can incorporate quality signals, such as SLA response and resolution compliance, incident closure times, service-level audit results, and deliverable consistency. These data points reflect the MSP’s ability to execute repeatably and reliably.
?? 2.5 Service Level Alignment
2.5 Service Level AlignmentOverviewWhat is the objective?Why is it important?As an MSP, why do I need to do this?What is the Customer impact?Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Alignment = “Are we delivering the right things for this client right now?”Concept #2: Decide Alignment in conversations, not in PSA reportsConcept #3: Keep Alignment scoring to a 3?3 rubric (fast ? one color)Concept #4: Segment-aware expectations (D?A) prevent over/under-servicingConcept #5: Alignment drives proposal rhythm and cadence (gate approvals)Concept #6: Triggers create tasks (Alignment ?

OverviewWhat is the objective?To ensure each client gets the right type and intensity of service for their maturity and appetite—right now. Alignment measures the fit between what’s expected (by segment and goal level) and what’s delivered (cadence, deliverables, roles). Keep it simple: 3–4 checks per account each month ? G/Y/R, and use QBRs to confirm and adjust.Why is it important?? Protects margin & focus: Stops over-servicing D/C accounts and under-servicing A/B accounts.? Prevents churn & stalls: Misalignment is a top cause of silent disengagement and slow approvals.? Enables scale: Clear, segment-based expectations allow a small CS team to work consistently.? Improves forecasting: GRR/NRR and initiative timing get more predictable when the service level fits the appetite.? Ties to quality & adoption: The right level unlocks smoother execution and higher DMI movement.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Run a segment menu, not one-offs: Publish what A/B/C/D get (QBR/JSP-Lite, roadmap, lifecycle, budget, vCIO time).? Measure fit with four checks (monthly):1. Cadence delivered vs plan,2. Core deliverables present (evidence + recap ≤48h),3. Exec sponsor seen ≤120 days (A/B),4. Effort mix roughly matches segment (ops vs advisory). Roll to G/Y/R and fix Reds with a first-action SLA ≤72h.? Gate big asks: Use the QBR credit gate (owner + date + budget) and pause expansion if alignment = Red.? Plan capacity clearly: Know when to add vCIO, keep TAM-led lifecycle, and reduce cadence..What is the Customer impact?? Less friction, more relevance: Meetings feel right-sized; proposals match goals and timing.? Faster decisions: Clear scope and cadence = fewer surprises and quicker approvals (max two decisions per QBR).? Trust in the rhythm: Clients see consistent follow-through and understand what’s included vs optional.? Visible progress: Alignment keeps adoption, service quality, and engagement moving together—so outcomes stick.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Alignment = “Are we delivering the right things for this client right now?”Typical MSP cases solved? Providing premium advisory to a D/C client that only wants stability.? Running ticket-only for a B/A client expecting roadmap, budgets, and exec touch.How to apply? Define Alignment as fit between service mix + cadence and the client’s segment (D?A) and goals.? Maintain a one-page Service Map per client: what we deliver, how often, who owns it, and which business goal it supports.Practical examples? C client: quarterly lifecycle review + 1–2 small initiatives; no executive QBR.? A client: quarterly executive QBR with roadmap, budget track, and OKR check.Common pitfalls? Equating “more service” with “better.”? Letting the legacy scope linger after the client’s needs changed.Concept #2: Decide Alignment in conversations, not in PSA reportsTypical MSP cases solved? Assuming alignment based on ticket volume or CSAT.? Missing silent misalignment (e.g., “roadmap feels generic”).How to apply? Use structured checkpoints: Discovery refresh, QBR, Lifecycle Review. Ask three quick questions:1. Relevance: “Does this still help hit your near-term goals?”2. Cadence fit: “Is the rhythm right (too much/too little)?”3. Coverage: “Are we missing anything material?”? Capture answers in JSP-Lite + Decision Log and adjust the Service Map.Practical examples? Add a 2-minute “Alignment check” at the end of every strategic meeting.? Tag feedback as Alignment notes in the QBR recap (visible next time).Common pitfalls? Fishing for NPS instead of relevance.? Skipping exec input on A/B accounts.Concept #3: Keep Alignment scoring to a 3?3 rubric (fast ? one color)Typical MSP cases solved? Complex scoring, no one updates.? Debates about “how misaligned is misaligned?”How to apply Score Presence / Perception / Performance (0–100 each), then average ? G/Y/R by segment:? Presence (40%) – expected services for the segment exist (e.g., roadmap for B/A, lifecycle for C).? Perception (30%) – client says services are relevant/valuable (captured in notes/pulse).? Performance (30%) – services delivered on time and at the correct depth. Threshold starters: D ≥70/55–69/<55 · C ≥75/60–74/<60 · B ≥80/70–79/<70 · A ≥85/75–84/<75.Practical examples? B account: Presence 90, Perception 70, Performance 80 ? 0.4·90 + 0.3·70 + 0.3·80 = 80 (Green).Common pitfalls? Changing weights mid-year.? Measuring activity instead of fit (too many meetings are still misaligned).Concept #4: Segment-aware expectations (D?A) prevent over/under-servicingTypical MSP cases solved? D/C drowning in strategy meetings they didn’t ask for.? A/B stalling because they don’t get exec-level outputs.How to apply? D: Support/stability; clear comms; minimal strategy.? C: Lifecycle hygiene + small, well-scoped improvements.? B: Modernization roadmap + budget rhythm; projectized delivery.? A: Executive QBRs, OKR link, portfolio view and risks.Practical examples? C: swap monthly “reports” for quarterly lifecycle + adoption minis.? A: Include “Decision ? Owner ? Date ? Budget” block in every QBR.Common pitfalls? One flat engagement model.? Publishing the same deck to every segment.Concept #5: Alignment drives proposal rhythm and cadence (gate approvals)Typical MSP cases solved? Proposals are pushed while the service model feels off to the client.? “Why no approvals?” ? misalignment, not price.How to apply? Gate: If Alignment = Red for 2+ months, pause new initiatives >$X until a Roadmap Reset is recorded in the QBR notes.? Pace proposals to the segment: more, smaller approvals in C; fewer, larger exec decisions in A.Practical examples? QBR first slide: Alignment snapshot ? either “Go / Fix first.”? Allow “quick wins” during Red (low-risk fixes that rebuild trust).Common pitfalls? Waiving the gate “just this time.”? Treating misalignment as a discount issue.Concept #6: Triggers create tasks (Alignment ? Playbooks), not more meetingsTypical MSP cases solved? Noticing misalignment, but nothing changes.? Long internal threads without an owner or due date.How to apply Stand up four automation-first triggers (plus two optional). Each opens a CTA with owner + due-by + checklist:1. Perception = Red ? Owner: CSM · 5 biz days ? Play: client value check + reset summary.2. Presence gap (missing required deliverable for segment) ? Owner: TAM/CSM · 10 days ? Play: add/replace service; update Service Map.3. Performance slip (late roadmap/lifecycle twice) ? Owner: vCIO/Lead · 72h ? Play: resequence + risk note; confirm next checkpoint.4. Segment drift signal (engagement/adoption up or down) ? Owner: CSM · 7 days ? Play: propose segment review. Optional: stakeholder change ? exec intro play; repeated “generic roadmap” feedback ? enablement coaching for owner.Practical examples? Dashboard widget: “Alignment CTAs open / time-to-first-action (≤72h target).”? Snippet pack: “We heard X, we’ll adjust Y by Z date.”Common pitfalls? Assigning “to the team.”? No due dates or defined outputs.Concept #7: Clear ownership + RACI tie-in (and comp)Typical MSP cases solved? Everyone “kind of” owns alignment.? vCIO pulled into ticket triage; TAM chasing execs.How to apply? D/C: CSM/TAM Accountable for Alignment (cadence + lifecycle fit).? B/A: vCIO Accountable (roadmap/budget relevance, exec alignment).? Mirror this in the RACI-by-Segment and link to Compensation (Alignment trend/guardrails as a small Health component).Practical examples? Scorecard line: “Alignment colour this month” with owner initials.? Quarterly Governance: “Who owns fixes for misaligned accounts?”Common pitfalls? Splitting accountability across roles.? There is no owner visibility on the one-pager.
Implementation ProcessStep 1 — Publish the Segment Service Menu (what each tier gets)Goal: Make “what’s included” and who owns it crystal-clear for A/B/C/D.Owner: CS Lead (with vCIO, CSM/AM, TAM)Timebox: 60–90 min workshopDo this? One page/table with deliverables & cadence by segment (e.g., A: Exec QBR, Roadmap, Budget; B: QBR, Roadmap; C: Lifecycle Review; D: Ops Check-in).? Add role A/R/C/I per deliverable (ties to Roles/Responsibilities).? Mark the evidence anchor for each (QBR note with owner + date + budget; meeting recap ≤48h). Definition of done? A/B/C/D menu is posted; the team can answer “What does B get?” in one sentence.Step 2 — Build the Alignment Scorecard + G/Y/R rules (4 checks)Goal: Score fit monthly with lightweight, repeatable rules.Owner: CS Lead + CS Ops-lite/FinanceTimebox: 60 min to templateDo this? Use four checks (each 25 pts). Calibrate by segment:1. Cadence delivered vs plan (held on time, attendees present).2. Core deliverables present with recap ≤48h and links.3. Exec sponsor seen ≤120 days (A/B only; C/D = N/A or substitute “service owner confirmed”).4. Effort mix fits segment (A/B = advisory-heavier; C/D = ops-heavier).? Scoring: Green ≥85, Yellow 65–84, Red <65. (If you want simpler: Green = 3–4 checks true; Yellow = 2; Red = 0–1.)Definition of done? One-pager scorecard exists; anyone can score an account in <5 minutes.Step 3 — Map evidence & wire simple flags (one source of truth)Goal: Ensure every check has a place to live and can be audited.Owner: CS Ops-lite (or CS Lead)Timebox: 60 min mappingDo this? “What lives where” map: PSA (initiatives/tasks/SLA), CRM (contacts/exec sponsor), CS/Health tool (scores/CTAs/playbooks), Files (QBR/JSP-Lite).? Add two tiny hygiene items to templates: “2 decisions max” per QBR; credit gate = owner + date + budget.? Create auto-flags (reports or views):? “Exec sponsor last seen” (days)? “Recap ≤48 h% (last 30 days)”? “Cadence on-time %”Definition of done?

New CTAs created; following portfolio review shows time-to-first-action ≤72h.Step 5 — Use Alignment to pace proposals & cadences (gate expansion)Goal: Don’t sell into misalignment; fix fit ? then ask.Owner: vCIO (A/B), CSM/AM (C/D)Timebox: In normal QBR prepDo this? Start QBR with a 1-slide Alignment snapshot (G/Y/R, what changed, next fix).? Keep a maximum of two decisions per QBR; only count expansion with the credit gate artifact.? Guardrail: If the alignment is red for two consecutive months, pause the expansion credit and resequence to alignment fixes; resume when yellow/green is used.Definition of done? QBR decks show the Alignment slide; proposal rhythm reflects alignment status.Step 6 — Quarterly tune & capacity planning (governance)Goal: Keep the model tight as segments and workload shift.Owner: CS Lead + LeadershipTimebox: 45–60 min/quarterDo this? Recheck segment placement (A?B?C?D) based on CX/DMI/Engagement.? Adjust effort mix targets (advisory vs ops) and meeting cadence where needed.? Review disputes/exceptions; update thresholds or plays once/quarter (not mid-quarter).? Ensure Accountable owners in RACI match Compensation levers. Definition of done? Updated menu/thresholds published; following quarter capacity forecasted.Minimal artifacts to publish (fits on one page each)? Segment Service Menu (A/B/C/D deliverables & cadence, owner A/R/C/I).? Alignment Scorecard (4 checks, G/Y/R rules).? What Lives Where map + QBR credit-gate checklist.? Playbook cards for the 4 Red types (owner, steps, snippets).That’s it—four checks, one score, clear plays. It stays calculable in a spreadsheet, auditable in your PSA/CRM/CS tool, and perfectly in sync with Roles, Responsibilities, Enablement, and Governance.
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?LevelRole of Service Level Alignment1.1 Technology SupportService is highly standardized, with a focus on execution rather than customization.1.2 Technology EnablementService begins aligning with maturity, e.g., onboarding and platform rollout.1.3 Technology ModernizationAlignment ensures that delivery aligns with strategic tech roadmaps and cadence.1.4 Business TransformationServices expand to reflect business-specific goals and cross-departmental needs.1.5 Business InnovationServices are tailored to meet OKRs, departmental objectives, and innovation initiatives.How does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Client Business Goal - Service level alignment is determined by the client’s maturity and appetite, which define their current business goals. This ensures services match both their operational capacity and strategic intent.? 3. Customer Success Delivery - The type, frequency, and depth of CS deliverables are shaped by service level alignment. As client needs evolve, delivery adapts to ensure value is created proportionately to its potential impact.? 4. Customer Success Process - The expected service level influences planning, cadence, and engagement workflows. Over-delivery creates unnecessary load; under-delivery risks missed goals or client frustration.? 6.

?? 3. CS Delivery
3. CS DeliverablesTurning Strategy into Tangible ValueCS Deliverables include five key blueprints:3.1. Reports3.2. Proposals3.3. Budgets3.4. Client Strategy3.5. RoadmapIn Summary
Turning Strategy into Tangible ValueCustomer Success isn’t just about meetings and conversations—it’s about delivering tangible outputs that drive momentum, validate alignment, and connect IT strategy to business priorities.CS Deliverables are where strategy becomes visible. They turn insights into structured assets that clients can review, approve, act on, and share with stakeholders. These outputs help MSPs show—not just say—where value is being created.“Deliverables are where intentions become outcomes—and where clients start to feel the value of your work.”As clients move up the maturity and appetite curve, deliverables evolve—from tactical snapshots to integrated business assets. The format may stay consistent (e.g., report, roadmap, budget), but the depth, framing, and strategic language shift to match each client’s segmentation tier and business goal level.CS Deliverables include five key blueprints:3.1. ReportsWhat it is: Structured assets—automated or manually curated—that present key information on the client’s environment, risks, priorities, and progress.How it evolves: From operational snapshots (e.g., hardware lifecycle, ticket metrics) to executive-ready summaries that link MSP activities to business objectives, trends, and initiative outcomes.Why it matters:? Creates transparency and shared understanding? Anchors strategic meetings with facts, not assumptions? Enables async alignment across roles and departments? Increases trust through repeatable structureBusiness Goal connection:At early stages, reports prove delivery. They become part of business storytelling at higher levels, helping clients evaluate ROI, timing, and alignment. Reports evolve into a platform for decision-making, not just documentation.3.2. ProposalsWhat it is:Scoped recommendations and financial estimates for client initiatives—formatted for approval, follow-up, and internal coordination.How it evolves:From simple itemized quotes to strategic proposals grounded in Discovery, Assessment, and Roadmap context. Includes business rationale and projected impact.Why it matters:? Ties the initiative scope to strategic appetite and maturity? Builds trust through clarity and pre-qualification? Speeds up approvals and avoids scope misalignmentBusiness Goal connection:As clients move toward Transformation and Innovation, proposals must evolve into value stories, not just cost outlines. Strategic proposals are a bridge between opportunity and execution.3.3. BudgetsWhat it is: Forecasts of expected IT investment across OpEx, CapEx, and projects—aligned with roadmap milestones and initiative planning.How it evolves: From ad hoc renewal tracking to annual budget plans that reflect segment-based pacing, initiative tiers, and future-state goals.Why it matters:? Empowers clients to plan ahead? Reinforces initiative, timing, and prioritization? Positions the MSP as a financial planning partnerBusiness Goal connection: At higher maturity levels, budgets are tied to roadmap progress, initiative grouping, and business planning cycles. They shift from reporting costs to funding strategy, which is especially important in Segments A and B.3.4. Client StrategyWhat it is: A client-facing strategic narrative that integrates goals, risks, roadmaps, and budget into one cohesive decision-making framework.How it evolves: From informal themes to structured strategy plans tied to industry context, segment posture, and leadership direction.Why it matters:? Provides context for initiative prioritization? Reinforces the MSP’s role as a strategic advisor? Aligns decisions across leadership and technical teamsBusiness Goal connection: Clients in Transformation and Innovation (1.4–1.5) require integrated strategic framing. Strategy deliverables connect CS execution to departmental OKRs and C-level priorities.3.5. RoadmapWhat it is: A visual, time-based layout of planned initiatives—sequenced by priority, readiness, and impact.How it evolves: From quarter-based task lists to multi-layered transformation maps categorized by business domain, timeline, or strategic theme.Why it matters:? Ensures continuity and visibility across planning cycles? Tracks initiative dependencies and business alignment? Clarifies decision timelines and stakeholder accountabilityBusiness Goal connection: A roadmap is the strategic spine of the engagement. For Segment A/B clients, it reflects initiative layering, timing, and budget readiness. For C/D clients, it simplifies scope and cadence.Definitions: CS Deliverables1. Roadmap A simple, visual timeline that shows clients exactly what technology improvements or projects are planned, including when each step will happen. It helps clients see clearly how you'll move from today’s reality to future goals.2. Initiative (Projects) Clearly defined actions or projects, each designed to solve a specific problem or seize an opportunity uncovered during assessments or client conversations. Initiatives turn strategy into practical, achievable tasks.3. Proposal A clearly outlined recommendation you give the client, detailing exactly what will be done, how much it will cost, and what benefits they'll see. Proposals help clients quickly understand, evaluate, and approve your recommendations.4. Budget A clear, forward-looking financial plan that shows what the client is expected to invest in technology over the coming months or years. Budgets help clients plan their finances confidently, knowing exactly what to expect and when.5. Client Strategy A concise, client-facing summary that clearly explains the long-term plan for technology alignment and improvement. It helps the client understand the purpose behind each initiative, how it supports their business, and what success looks like.6. Executive Report A high-level, easy-to-understand report prepared for business leaders that summarizes technology performance, risks, progress, and opportunities. It helps executives quickly grasp how IT aligns with their broader business objectives.7. Assessment Report A structured report showing exactly where the client stands in key technology areas, highlighting risks, issues, or improvement opportunities. It makes technical issues clear and understandable, allowing informed decisions.8. Discovery Summary A clear and concise overview of key insights and priorities gathered during initial client conversations. It ensures both parties understand the business goals, concerns, and opportunities from the start.9. Cadence Planner An internal schedule that clearly defines when and how often client meetings, reviews, and planning sessions happen, based on the client's segment and goals. It ensures consistency and helps you plan effectively.10. Statement of Work (SOW) A formal document outlining exactly what tasks or deliverables you will provide, when they'll be delivered, and what outcomes the client can expect. It removes ambiguity, helping both parties stay aligned and accountable.In SummaryCS Deliverables are the execution engine of Customer Success. When tailored to client maturity and appetite, they:? Communicate value in a way clients can understand? Align internal and external stakeholders at every level? Accelerate initiative acceptance and business planning? Anchor all CS processes—Discovery, Assessment, Meetings—in visible progressEach deliverable plays a role in the broader CS ecosystem. Together, they transform Discovery insights into outcomes and ensure Customer Success is not just a conversation, but a measurable business result.

OverviewWhat is the objective?To create and deliver clear, structured, and visually engaging reports that reflect the client's current IT state, business alignment, risk exposure, service delivery, and roadmap progress, supporting informed decisions and reinforcing MSP credibility.Why is it important?Reports are not just documentation—they are activation tools in the Customer Success delivery chain. They provide a shared language between technical teams and business stakeholders, translating service activity and CS Process insights (from Discovery and Assessment) into clear business value.Done right, reports serve as the connective tissue between the CS Process and CS Delivery—bridging insights and context with decision-ready outputs, such as Initiatives, Budgets, and Roadmaps. They create continuity between meetings, reinforce trust, and enable executive-level planning with consistent, data-rich summaries. Without reports, strategic alignment breaks down and initiative momentum stalls. A decision-first report (two asks max) accelerates approvals, and standard guardrails—recap ≤ 48h and first-action SLA ≤ 72h—ensure follow-through instead of “report parking.”As an MSP, why do I need to do this?Because without transparent, segment-aligned reporting, your clients won’t connect your efforts to their outcomes. Reports transform invisible effort into visible progress. They give structure to your CS cadence and help move the conversation from service delivery to strategic value.With a solid reporting rhythm, even junior team members can confidently frame initiatives, budgets, and roadmaps. Reports support proposal approvals, showcase risk mitigation, and highlight technology improvements—all through a repeatable format that aligns with your engagement strategy.Done right, reports are not just summaries—they are decision enablers that link CS Process (Discovery, Assessment) to CS Delivery (Initiatives, Budgets, Roadmaps). They turn your insights into action.Define “delivered” by segment (live presentation for A/B; async + short video for C/D) and track simple KPIs: Snapshot present ≥ 95%, live-delivery rate (A/B) ≥ 80%, ≥1 logged decision in ≥ 70% of strategic reports.What is the Customer impact?? Clients understand how IT investments support their business goals.? Builds trust through transparency, insight, and strategic context.? Promotes co-ownership of priorities through clear documentation.? Enhances the MSP's perceived value in planning, budgeting, and risk management.? Decisions move faster thanks to the Executive Snapshot and two clear asks, while visible follow-through (recap ≤ 48h, first-action ≤ 72h) increases confidence. High-touch clients get an engaging live walkthrough; lower-touch clients still receive a concise summary video to make the report actionable.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Present, don’t just send — you are the reportReports are not just deliverables—they are strategic conversations. Just like a proposal should be presented, not emailed, a report should be delivered, not just sent.When you present the report, you become the storyteller. You guide the client through the data, explain the significance, and tie it directly to their business outcomes. Whether it’s operational metrics in a service report, strategic KPIs in an executive report, or recommendations in a consulting report, you are the interpreter, the context, and the voice of value.Presenting live, either in person or virtually, builds clarity, trust, and engagement. It allows you to answer questions, frame decisions, and reinforce your MSP’s role as a strategic advisor, not just a service provider.It also ensures that CS Health signals—especially Engagement and Alignment—are captured and reviewed during the conversation, rather than being lost in asynchronous delivery.Why it matters: Live delivery builds clarity, captures questions, and reinforces your advisory role.How to apply (plain rules):? A/B segments: deliver live; target live-delivery ≥ 80%.? C/D segments: deliver async + 2–3 min summary video.? Always open with the Executive Snapshot (Business Outcomes, mini Health, Risks/Trends, max two decisions).? Assign a presenter by role: vCIO (A/B), CSM/TAM (B/C), AM supports budgets/renewals.Practical example: Quarterly Executive Report for a Segment B client: vCIO presents live for 20 minutes; two decisions pre-framed; CSM records decisions and owners.Common pitfalls: Emailing PDFs with no session; reading slides word-for-word; no decision ask.Concept #2: Segment-Driven Report StrategyReporting must be built for and aligned to the client’s Segment—not just the cadence or delivery model. Each report—its depth, content, and presentation style—should reflect the client’s strategic relevance, maturity, and appetite as defined by the segmentation model (Segment A–D / Business Goal Levels 1.1–1.5).Segment A (Level 4–5 – Business Transformation and Innovation) receive comprehensive, strategy-heavy reports:? Roadmap, Budget, Goals, and CS Health metrics, all structured to support OKR alignment and executive planning.? Delivery is live, interactive, and conducted via Presentation Mode with a monthly or every other month rhythm.? Reports are directly tied to initiative status, adoption trends, and cross-departmental alignment, supporting real co-planning.Segment B (Level 3 – Technology Modernization) receive structured, quarterly reports that balance strategic and tactical content:? Core elements include Roadmap Milestones, Risk Trends, and Technology Alignment Summaries.? Reports are either delivered live or as hybrid (shared with a summary walkthrough).? Engagement, Adoption, and Service Quality Health scores should be included to flag readiness or bottlenecks.Segment C (Level 2 – Technology Enablement) receive simplified, tactical reports:? Focused on project execution, adoption progress, and service quality outcomes.? Delivered quarterly or semi-annually, typically in async formats (e.g., PDF + summary email).? Health insights are included in basic form—particularly Engagement and Service Level Alignment.Segment D (Level 1 – Technology Support) receive lightweight, auto-generated reporting:? Content covers ticket trends, asset risk, compliance snapshots, or SLA metrics.? Delivered via email or client portal, these are built for operational stability, not strategy.? Reports act as trust signals and provide transparency, not decision-making tools.Key principle: Standardize report design by segment—don’t build custom reports from scratch for each client.Segment-based templates (e.g., “Segment A Strategic QBR,” “Segment C Tactical Summary”) allow CS teams to:? Focus on what matters most to each segment? Scale report production without sacrificing relevance? Connect reporting cadence directly to the Engagement Strategy and resource allocation planStructured CS Health data ensures that each report serves its strategic purpose: A ? alignment & innovation readiness • B ? modernization momentum • C ? enablement progress • D ? operational reliability.This segment-driven model makes reporting a lever for strategic growth, not just a documentation exercise. It supports clarity, consistency, and co-planning—while reducing effort duplication and enabling role-specific ownership across the CS team. Concept #3: Decision-first reporting = Executive Snapshot + two asksWhy it matters: Clients act when the next two moves are obvious, justified, and time-bound.How to apply:? Start every strategic report with an Executive Snapshot:1. Business Outcomes & risks,2. Mini Health (CX/Engagement/Adoption/Quality/Alignment),3. Key trendlines,4. Two decisions only — each with Why this / Why now / Expected impact / Owner & target date.? Gate “expansion credit” on owner + date + budget being confirmed.? Track report hygiene KPIs: Snapshot present ≥ 95%; ≥1 logged decision in ≥ 70% of strategic reports.Practical example: “Approve MFA rollout Phase 2 (Why now: insurance requirement; Impact: risk ?; Owner: CFO; Date: Jun 15).”Common pitfalls: Ten recommendations with no priorities; burying the ask; no “Why now.”Concept #4: Three report types, one story spineReports are not one-size-fits-all—they serve different purposes depending on the audience and objective. The three core types:? Service Reports – Regular, detail-oriented for IT managers and technical staff (tickets, backup, patching, SLA). Focus: operational transparency and accountability.? Executive Reports – High-level, strategic summaries for business leaders (outcomes, risk trends, ROI, initiative progress, roadmap). Format: visual, concise, outcome-oriented.? Consultant Reports – One-off deep dives or project scoping (maturity assessment, opportunity analysis, strategic recommendations, phased plan).Label reports clearly and align the content to the client’s role and business goals at the appropriate level. This ensures every stakeholder receives the insights they need, in the format they expect. All report types should contribute to—or be informed by—CS Health scoring (Service ? Quality, Executive ? Engagement/Alignment, Consultant ? Adoption/strategy).Why it matters: Different audiences, same narrative: Context ? Highlights ? Action Drivers ? What’s Next.How to apply:? Service: SLA/tickets/backup/patching; audience = IT lead; cadence = monthly/quarterly.? Executive: outcomes/risks/roadmap/budget; audience = execs; cadence = quarterly; present live for A/B.? Consultant: deep-dive/scoping; include phased plan + health impacts.? Reuse the same spine to reduce prep and increase comprehension.Practical example: Assessment (Consultant) ? Executive Report distills two decisions ? Service Report tracks follow-through.Common pitfalls: Data dumps without a spine; executive decks full of minutiae; inconsistent section order. Concept #5: Reports are CS Health checkpoints (with follow-through SLAs)Every report is a moment to measure and move Health.Why it matters: Health signals guide pace and sequencing—ignore them and momentum dies.How to apply:? Always show the mini Health dashboard and note change vs. last meeting.? Send recap ≤ 48h using a standard template (decisions, owners, dates, risks).? Open CTAs with first-action SLA ≤ 72h (owner assigned, next step logged).? Portfolio KPIs: Recap ≤ 48h ≥ 95%, First-action ≤ 72h ≥ 95%.Practical example: Executive Report shows Engagement dip ? schedule Re-engage session; CTA opened same day; owner = CSM.Common pitfalls: Reporting Health but not acting; week-late recaps; CTAs without owners.Concept #6: Why clients ignore reports (and how to fix it)Why they ignore:? No context. If the report doesn’t tie to the last conversation—or the next decision—it feels irrelevant.? Too much detail, too little meaning. Technical charts without strategic framing exhaust attention.? Wrong audience. Not tailored to role, priorities, or language ? “just another PDF.”? No follow-through. If it doesn’t lead to a discussion, decision, or plan, clients tune out.? No narrative. Without a beginning (what changed), middle (what matters), end (what’s next), it’s noise.Fixes (practical):? Start with the Executive Snapshot; stick to two decisions.? Use role-based views (executive vs. operational).? Keep slides to signal, not to impress; push depth to appendix/report locker.? Enforce recap ≤ 48h and first-action ≤ 72h; review in the next meeting.Practical example: Replace a 30-slide dump with a 1-page snapshot + 6 supporting slides; appendix holds the technical evidence.Common pitfalls: Over-surveying for input, then changing nothing; sending decks without a meeting; “FYI only” reports.
Implementation ProcessTurning insights into segment-calibrated reports that drive decisionsThe Reports Implementation Process helps MSPs turn Customer Success insights into decision-ready, segment-aligned reports that clients will actually use. It embeds live vs. async delivery rules, an Executive Snapshot with two asks, and follow-through SLAs (≤48h / ≤72h) so reports move CS Health and roadmap momentum—not just document activity.Step 1: Determine Reporting Format and Frequency by Segment and Goal LevelUse Segmentation and Engagement Strategy to define how often you report and how you deliver it. Pair cadence with delivery mode and presenter so every report lands with context.Goal LevelReport CadenceDelivery ModePrimary FocusTypical Owner / PresenterSegment D_  Goal 1 – Technology SupportAd hoc or auto-generatedEmail / Client Portal (auto reports)Tickets, SLA, asset/lifecycle risk snapshotsCSM/TAM = async owner; AM back-up for renewalsSegment C_ Goal 2 – Technology EnablementQuarterly or semi-annualAsync PDF + 2–3-minute summary videoProject execution, adoption progress, service quality outcomesCSM/TAM = presenter/owner; AM supports budgetsSegment B_ Goal 3 – Technology ModernizationQuarterlyLive or hybrid (shared deck + walkthrough)Roadmap milestones, risk trends, alignment summary, Health highlightsvCIO = presenter; CSM/TAM = recorder; AM = budget/renewal supportSegment A: Goals 4–5 – Business Transformation & InnovationMonthly or bi-monthlyLive delivery (target ≥ 80%) via Presentation ModeOutcomes/OKRs, risks, roadmap, budget, CS HealthvCIO = presenter; AM = budget framing; CSM/TAM = recorderDefinition of Done / KPI: Each active account has a set cadence and a named presenter; Segments A (Goals 4–5) and B (Goal 3) live-delivery rate ≥ 80%.This segmentation-driven cadence ensures reports are not just sent, but experienced as part of a structured Customer Success journey—aligned to both strategic relevance and economic scale. High-value segments receive live, consultative reporting experiences; lower-touch clients receive automated, scalable updates, still mapped to CS Health and roadmap checkpoints.Step 2: Structure the report to reflect strategic intentOpen every report with a decision-first Executive Snapshot, then follow the same story spine.Executive Snapshot (page 1, always):? Business Outcomes & risks (what changed since last touchpoint)? Mini Health (CX, Engagement, Adoption, Service Quality, Alignment) with ? vs. last meeting? Key trendlines (tops & tails only)? Two decisions max, each with: Why this / Why now / Expected impact / Owner & target dateStory spine: Context ? Highlights ? Action Drivers ? What’s Next (push technical depth to appendix/locker). Expansion credit gate: Count expansion only when the owner + date + budget are confirmed. KPI: Snapshot present ≥ 95% across strategic reports.Step 3: Link each report to CS Process & CS Health (with follow-through SLAs)Reports are CS Health checkpoints and Process connectors.Tie-ins:? Process inputs: Discovery & Assessment power the narrative; Initiatives/Budgets/Roadmap supply the actions and timing.? Health hooks: If Engagement dips or Adoption is below the threshold, auto-schedule a Re-engage/Remediation session and surface it in the next Meeting agenda.Follow-through SLAs:? Recap ≤ 48h (decisions, owners, dates, risks)? CTA first-action ≤ 72h per decision (owner assigned, next step logged)Portfolio KPIs: Recap ≤ 48h ≥ 95% • First-action ≤ 72h ≥ 95% • ≥1 logged decision in ≥ 70% of strategic reportsStep 4: Assign Reporting Ownership by RoleMap roles to your segment labels so delivery is consistent and scalable.Role map (presenter/recorder/back-up):? Segments A (Goals 4–5) / B (Goal 3): vCIO = Presenter; AM = Budget support; CSM/TAM = Recorder? Segments B (Goal 3) / C (Goal 2): CSM or TAM = Presenter; AM = Budget support as needed; Recorder = CSM/TAM? Segment D (Goal 1): CSM/TAM = Async owner (auto report + optional 2–3 min video); AM back-up for renewalsDefinition of Done: Every account shows a named presenter, recorder, and back-up aligned to the segment.Step 5: Operationalize with Templates and GovernanceStandardize once, then scale.Templates:? Use segment-based templates (e.g., “Segment A – Strategic QBR,” “Segment C – Tactical Summary”)? Lock the Executive Snapshot as mandatory? Pre-wire Mini Health and Two decisions blocks? Add appendix modules (Assessments, Initiative detail, Lifecycle, SLA, etc.)Governance & hygiene:? Monthly review of report KPIs: Snapshot ≥ 95%, Recap ≤ 48h ≥ 95%, First-action ≤ 72h ≥ 95%, ≥1 logged decision ≥ 70%? Corrective Play (2 consecutive misses): Template refresh + coach presenter; gate expansion credit until back to Green.Tooling tips: Use presentation mode for A/B; store evidence in a report locker; auto-pull service metrics for C/D; link to detailed views instead of bloating the deck.Outcome: Reports That Drive Action and Prove ValueYour reporting rhythm now:? Connects CS Process insights to CS Delivery outcomes? Moves CS Health with time-boxed follow-through? Clarifies ownership by segment label and role? Matches economics (live where it matters, async where it scales)Success signal: Decisions made and kept; strong Snapshot hygiene; on-time recaps; ≤72h first actions; steady approval velocity tied to the roadmap across Segments D/C/B/A as defined above.
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?Reports evolve as the client's maturity and appetite increase. At lower levels, they focus on operational transparency; at higher levels, they drive business strategy and innovation. The scope and content of the report are shaped by the client's goals, investment readiness, and need for structured accountability.LevelRole of Reports1.1 Technology SupportReports focus on infrastructure visibility and tactical operations, including backups, ticket volumes, and asset health, targeting a low-impact, low-engagement audience.1.2 Technology EnablementBegin showing tool adoption, project impact, and alignment gaps. High-impact topics but low engagement—clients need guidance.1.3 Technology ModernizationShowcase stack trends, risks, and roadmap relevance. Higher-impact, strategic audience—ready to act but needs reinforcement.1.4 Business TransformationCapture ROI, cross-functional metrics, and initiative status. Reports support strategic prioritization and momentum.1.5 Business InnovationReports reflect long-term OKRs, innovation themes, and AI readiness. High maturity and high engagement—executive-level strategy.How does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Client Business Goal – Reports reflect client maturity, appetite, and strategic direction, making progress visible.? 2. Customer Success Health – Reports surface Health metrics through visual summaries of:? CX sentiment (e.g., CSAT, NPS)? Technology Adoption Trends? Engagement (meeting cadence, follow-ups)? Service Quality (SLA, tickets)? Service Level Alignment (goal and playbook alignment)? 3. Customer Success Delivery – Reports bring together Assessments, Budgets, Roadmaps, and Initiatives—showing the outcome of all CS activities.? 4. Customer Success Process – Delivered on cadence, driven by Discovery, and supporting Initiative alignment.? 6. Customer Success People – Empowers vCIOs, CSMs, and AMs to lead strategic conversations with confidence and data-driven insights.? 7.

OverviewWhat is the objective?To activate the CS strategy by translating Discovery and Assessment insights into clearly scoped, segment-aligned proposals—bridging CS Process with CS Delivery. Proposals define mutual expectations (scope, impact, timeline, budget) and serve as the formal transition from plan to action in the Customer Success lifecycle.Why is it important?Because without well-timed, well-framed proposals, CS insights stall and initiatives remain ideas. Proposals:? Connect CS Process (Discovery, Assessment, Roadmap) to CS Delivery (Initiatives, Budgets, Execution)? Clarify what needs to happen, when, and why, based on strategic insight? Build confidence and trust by showing clients that recommendations are prioritized, structured, and financially sound? Provide a single source of truth for service teams, finance, and clients.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?Strategic alignment without execution is merely theory. A clear, segment-matched proposal:? Aligns CS workstreams to business context, client appetite, and timing? Secures buy-in through early financial signalling and phased rollout options? Prevents ghosted ideas by turning roadmap items into scoped, fundable actions? Feeds the pipeline for services, staffing, and resource planning—improving predictability? Connects back to discovery: This is where you prove you're listening and turning insight into progressWhat is the Customer impact?Clients:? Gain clarity on investment, scope, and timing? Feel included in decision-making, not just reactive approval? Align internal stakeholders around strategic technology priorities? Receive fewer surprises and more transparency? View the MSP as a structured partner, not an ad-hoc vendor
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: A Proposal Is a Gated Process—Not the First StepNever build a proposal before validating interest. It’s a common pitfall: MSPs jump into detailed scoping and packaging because it feels productive—while skipping the hard but essential question: is the client ready?Instead of diving into the “how,” start with the “would you?” This is called price testing—a lightweight validation method to test both interest and feasibility, using real-world comparisons.Say:“Similar clients have solved this in the $10K–$15K range—does that sound viable for your team this quarter?”This approach respects the client’s investment expectations and gives you an early appetite signal without overcommitting internal time. It also lets you gracefully pause when the client isn’t ready—without burning hours on deliverables that go nowhere.Price testing is part of the Closed Loop Theory: each Discovery or Assessment insight must pass a readiness checkpoint before proposal development begins.Expanded with a Practical Example: A vCIO hears about a legacy firewall that’s due for replacement. Instead of scoping the whole upgrade, they say: “We’ve helped other clients transition to zero-trust firewalls for around $9K. Should we look into it further?” The client says, “Yes, if it’s under $10K and can be done before our audit.” Only then does the team build the proposal.Impact:? Reduces time lost on proposals that aren’t actionable? Increases trust by aligning early on budget range and intent? Helps CS teams prioritize where to focus planning energyConcept #2: Match Proposal Complexity to Segment and Spend TypeProposal depth should reflect both the client segment and spending behaviour.? Lower-maturity, lower-appetite clients (Segment D or 1.1–1.2 Goal Levels) tend to prefer operational expenditure (OpEx)- focused proposals, such as licenses, recurring services, or tactical upgrades. These clients benefit from straightforward scopes, clear timelines, and streamlined approvals.? Higher-maturity, high-appetite clients (Segment A or 1.4–1.5) are ready for CapEx-aligned proposals, such as strategic platforms, innovation pilots, or multi-phase projects. These need layered proposals with clear ROI language, long-term outcomes, and formal approval processes.Your proposal process should scale with the segment:? Boutique (9% MRR CS investment): polished presentations, linked to OKRs? Cost Driver (1%): one-click summaries embedded in meeting notesProposal complexity should also correlate with CS Health indicators. High Engagement and Adoption enable richer, more strategic proposals. Low Service Alignment or Execution consistency suggests a need to simplify or delay.Concept #3: Tie Proposals to Budget, Roadmap, and Business GoalsEvery proposal must serve as a bridge—not just between CS Process and CS Delivery, but also between the client’s stated business goals, your roadmap plan, and the budget forecast.To do that, proposals should:? Reference prior Discovery or Assessment inputs – These reveal the “why” behind the initiative, not just the technical symptoms.? Link to Budget forecasts – Define when the client will likely fund the work, and how it fits into OpEx or CapEx expectations.? Embed into the Roadmap – Align timing and priority so the proposal is seen in context, not isolation.? Connect to Goals – Especially for low-maturity clients, use assessment-driven goals (e.g., “Improve Cyber Posture” or “Modernize Core Stack”) to translate technical recommendations into business-aligned outcomes.This is especially important for Segment D (Sustain) clients, where strategic goals are less explicit. In these cases:? Let Assessments define the Goal narrative (e.g., “You’re at a CSAT of 6.2 and your backup score is red—your goal is to reach stability”).? Use CS Health visuals (yellow/red scoring) to make risks and outcomes tangible.? Keep proposals framed in client value (“You’re currently at risk, and this will help you move into the green.”)Expanded with a Practical Example: A Segment D client has no defined roadmap, but an Assessment shows red scores in backup and patching. Instead of proposing upgrades directly, the MSP sets a goal: “Achieve foundational cyber hygiene.” The proposal says: “To reach a green status in Security Health, we recommend this $3.2K initiative. It moves you from 48% to 85% compliance.” The roadmap simply records the initiative under Q3, and the budget reserves the funding.Impact:? Lower-maturity clients engage with clearer outcomes, not technical specs? Risk-based proposals gain traction by connecting to visible pain? The roadmap and budget remain the client’s compass—not just a list of transactionsThis integrated approach reduces friction, improves proposal acceptance, and reinforces your CS narrative: from insight ? to goal ? to initiative ? to execution.Concept #4: Define Scope, Assumptions, and Client Responsibilities ClearlyA common challenge in MSP project proposals is the lack of clarity regarding what is included, what is assumed, and what the client is responsible for. This ambiguity can lead to misunderstandings, scope creep, and strained client relationships.To mitigate these risks, it's essential to explicitly define:? Scope of Work: Detail the specific services and deliverables the MSP will provide.? Assumptions: List any conditions assumed to be true for the project (e.g., "Client will provide access to necessary systems").? Client Responsibilities: Outline tasks or resources the client is expected to provide (e.g., "Client will supply hardware components").By clearly articulating these elements, MSPs can set proper expectations, reduce the likelihood of disputes, and ensure smoother project execution.Concept #5: Proposal hygiene = Executive Decision Sheet + Owner/Date/Budget gateWhy it mattersApprovals slip when proposals are long, unclear, or lack a crisp decision moment. A consistent “hygiene” standard makes approvals faster and auditable across roles.How to apply (plain rules)? Lead every proposal with a 1-page Executive Decision Sheet (front-matter before any appendix): Problem/Why now • Options (max 2) with cost band • Expected impact • Risks/assumptions • Owner & target date.? Approval hygiene gate: count “expansion credit” only when Owner + Date + Budget are confirmed in writing (same gate as QBR).? Follow-through SLAs: send a recap ≤ 48h (decisions, owners, dates, risks); open a CTA with first action ≤ 72h.? Segment fit:? A/B ? full deck + Decision Sheet, presented live.? C/D ? slim summary embedded in meeting notes/roadmap + Decision Sheet.Practical example “Approve MFA Phase 2 (Why now: insurance mandate; Impact: risk ?; Owner: CFO; Target: Jun 15; Budget: $12–15k).”Common pitfallsBurying the ask in slide 27 • More than 2 options • No written Owner/Date/Budget • Recap sent a week later.Concept #6: Proposal velocity & declines are Health signalsWhy it mattersProposal movement reflects Engagement, Alignment, and timing. Stalls and silent declines are early churn indicators unless you capture and act on them.How to apply (plain rules)? Track Time-to-first-action (CTA opened/owner set) ? target ≤ 72h.? Track Time-to-decision and aging buckets: 0–14d, 15–30d, >30d.? Stale > 30d ? trigger Re-engage play (cadence reset, reframe options).? > 60d with no movement ? auto-close or re-sequence on the roadmap; capture decline reason.? Portfolio KPIs to review monthly:? Win rate by segment? Median days-to-approval? % proposals with decline reason captured (≥ 90%)? % proposals linked to a roadmap slot/initiative ID (100%)Practical exampleSegment B proposal hits 32 days with no decision ? schedule a 20-min live reset, offer 2 options (now vs. next quarter), log reason if deferred, update roadmap & budget.Common pitfallsOrphan proposals with no roadmap link • No reason codes on declines • Chasing aged proposals without adjusting segment/cadence • Counting “verbal yes” without artifacts.
Implementation ProcessTurn insight into approval. The proposal is the formal handshake between CS planning and delivery execution.1. Trigger from strategic insight? Discovery reveals the opportunity? Assessment validates risk, readiness, or urgency? The proposal scopes the solution and timing2. Align proposal depth to the client’s segment and goal level? Segment A–B / Levels 4–5: deck-style proposals with OKRs, KPIs, timelines? Segment C–D / Levels 1–3: streamlined summaries embedded in the roadmap or meeting3. Embed in the Delivery and Budget cycles? Include budget reference, cost structure, and approval path? Tag proposal items as initiatives and track follow-through? Link to roadmap progress and CS Health indicators4. Present in context? Proposals are delivered live, not just sent? They frame decisions, not just documentationWhen done well, proposals are not standalone sales documents—they are activation tools in the CS operating system.
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?Proposals reflect the client’s position on the maturity and appetite curve. Their depth, frequency, and language shift with the Client Business Goal level:LevelProposal Role1.1 Technology SupportShort-form scopes for break/fix, patching, and basic backup—limited appetite.1.2 Technology EnablementService proposals tied to enablement projects (AV, SaaS standardization, firewall replacement). Still mostly OpEx.1.3 Technology ModernizationStack change proposals, lifecycle upgrades, endpoint refreshes. Multi-step projects with measurable outcomes.1.4 Business TransformationProposals formalize strategic initiatives, including workflow redesign, automation, and analytics. Often linked to department priorities.1.5 Business InnovationMulti-stakeholder initiatives with OKR alignment, new platforms, and co-funded pilots. The proposal serves as both an investment and a change document.How does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Client Business Goal - Proposals translate the client’s current goal level into defined CS workstreams, bridging business needs with technical execution in a scalable and understandable format.? 2. Customer Success Health - Proposal cadence and follow-through influence adoption, engagement, and service quality scores. Delayed or misaligned proposals signal breakdowns in planning or a lack of trust.? 3. Customer Success Delivery - Proposals form the entry point to delivery. They act as the contract for future deliverables, budgets, and meeting agendas.? 4. Customer Success Process - Discoveries or assessments often trigger the development of proposals. It defines the next steps in service intake and initiative launch.? 6. Customer Success People - TAMs, vCIOs, and CSMs rely on proposals to formalize their recommendations. Proposals also provide context for hand-offs to project managers or delivery teams.? 7. Customer Success Strategy - Proposal design and complexity are adapted based on segmentation, playbook maturity, and available CS capacity. This keeps engagement scalable and repeatable across clients.Product Links / Tooling SupportThe LMx Quoter Proposal feature enables MSPs to generate polished, professional proposals in seconds using reusable templates and standardized pricing.Key capabilities include:?

OverviewWhat is the objective?To deliver a clear, forward-looking financial plan that translates strategic initiatives into actionable investment timing. Budgets connect CS Process insights (Discovery, Assessment, Roadmap) to CS Delivery execution (Proposals, Projects, Renewals), enabling clients to prioritize confidently and MSPs to plan sustainably.Why is it important?Because budgets are not just about costs—they’re how CS strategy becomes reality. Without a budget, even the best roadmap lacks traction. A well-delivered budget:? Shows the client you’ve thought ahead—strategically and financially? Frame proposals in context, making approvals easier? Enables prioritization and phasing of initiatives? Reduces last-minute objections and increases decision speed? Helps the MSP stabilize delivery, hiring, and capacity by forecasting demandBudgets are where trust is earned, alignment is confirmed, and execution begins.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?Because if you’re not helping clients plan financially, you’re not acting as a strategic partner. A budget:? Connects CS workstreams across Discovery, Assessment, Roadmap, and Initiative planning? Secures buy-in with early price signals and realistic scheduling? Prevents stalled proposals and ghosted initiatives by clarifying timing and cost? Gives internal delivery teams a clearer view of what’s coming and when? Turns your strategic plan into a resource-backed execution pathBudgets are your way of saying: “We’re not just recommending this—we’ve thought through how and when you can afford to act.”What is the Customer impact?Budgets give clients clarity on what they’re spending, what’s changing, and what’s coming next. Done well:? They reduce last-minute objections or sticker shock? Clients can plan initiatives alongside broader business priorities? They improve confidence in the MSP’s advice and planning? Clients who don’t receive the proper budget format for their segment may disengage, especially if meeting time is wasted or initiative plans feel vague.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Budgets Reflect the CommitmentsBudgets are not just downstream outputs of Discovery, Assessment, and Reporting—they are the financial codification of mutual commitments. A well-structured budget signals that both parties agree on what needs to be done, why it matters, and when it’s realistic to execute.The budget answers the question: “When and how do we pay for what we have agreed needs to be done?”To build that answer, the MSP must consider the client's Client Business Goal, which is shaped by their maturity and strategic appetite. A high-maturity, high-appetite client may be ready for aggressive innovation cycles. A low-maturity, low-appetite client may only commit to tactical improvements.Your budget scope and delivery style should reflect where the client is today—and where they’re ready to go.Budgeting also plays a direct role in Customer Success Health, particularly in the Alignment, Adoption, and Engagement dimensions. A well-structured budget confirms strategic alignment, validates readiness for initiative delivery, and strengthens the engagement rhythm.Concept #2: Budgeting Is a Strategic Advisory Process, Not Just a SpreadsheetMany MSPS view budgeting as a static deliverable—“What does the client spend with us?” But the real value lies in the process of advising around financial planning, risk mitigation, and investment alignment. Budgeting enables the MSP to become a financially credible partner in the client's strategic planning, rather than just a vendor with a price list.This means:? Helping prioritize initiatives across OpEx, CapEx, and project spend? Providing input on timing and trade-offs based on business cycles or ROI potential? Bringing financial literacy into strategic planning conversations? Leading multi-stakeholder discussions about impact, resourcing, and sequencingAs maturity increases, the MSP shifts from submitting budget lines to guiding the budget conversation. Budgeting becomes the place where strategic alignment occurs, not just where numbers reside.It also becomes a crucial touchpoint in the CS Health feedback loop, where Engagement, Alignment, and Execution capabilities converge. Budgets reflect not only what the client wants to do, but also whether your MSP can reliably guide and deliver it.This concept echoes the “shared ownership” described in Level 5 Budget Maturity in the workshop doc: budgeting is not something you do for the client—it’s something you do with them. Strategic MSPs embed themselves in this process early and often.Concept #3: Price TestingClients don’t need a final quote to make early decisions—they need a financial signal to test interest. Instead of diving straight into detailed project scoping, MSPs should present initiative estimates early in the conversation. This acts as a “reality check” and helps clients self-qualify their interest and readiness. For example:“For similar clients, this type of initiative typically runs around $8K–$12K. Is that within a range that makes sense to solve this?”While LMx Budgets don’t support cost ranges natively, MSPs can use early estimates to test appetite. This keeps decision-making informal and faster, saving hours of planning on initiatives the client may not be ready to fund or prioritize. It also builds trust by respecting the client’s time and investment expectations.These early signals should be tracked and surfaced in CS Health scoring, particularly within Engagement and Appetite tracking, to inform whether formal budgeting is likely to succeed.How to applyLog every price test as a Budget Note with owner + quarter + range; if interest = no/“later,” tag and re-sequence on the roadmap.Concept #4: Pre-ApprovalPre-approval is the client’s informal commitment to proceed, often before the scope is finalized. It could be: “Let’s plan to do this in Q3 if the scope matches.” Or even: “If it’s under $12,000, we’re good.” This lightweight approval builds momentum and improves proposal hit rates, especially when roadmaps and budgets are presented in the same meeting.Pre-approvals are also valuable indicators of engagement within the CS Health system. When appropriately captured, they reflect momentum and can positively influence Engagement and Alignment scores.How to apply“Count pre-approval only when Owner + Target quarter + Budget band are recorded; send recap ≤48h and open a CTA ≤72h to prepare the proposal.”Concept #5: Do’s and Don’tsDo:? Match the depth of the forecast to the client’s engagement level? Keep initiative descriptions client-facing? Tie each item to a Discovery, Assessment, or Roadmap insight? Present multi-year plans in chunks—by quarter or half-year? Use budgeting milestones to validate CS Health indicators such as cadence participation, appetite alignment, and initiative readinessDon’t:? Overwhelm clients with overly detailed cost data? Assume budgets = approval. Always validate interest first? Skip the strategic connection—always link back to Discovery findings, Assessment validation, or Roadmap context? Ignore budget-stalling patterns—they are often signals of declining CS Health that require Governance follow-upConcept #6: Segment-Driven Budget Formats (keep it simple, by tier)Why it mattersBudgets land when the format matches attention span and decision depth. Over-formatting for D/C, or under-formatting for A/B, kills momentum.How to apply (plain rules)? Segment D (Goal 1 – Technology Support): 1-page list of renewals, licenses, overdue hardware; quarterly view; simple totals.? Segment C (Goal 2 – Technology Enablement): semi-annual view; add 2–4 near-term initiatives with rough ranges; short notes (“Why now / Impact”).? Segment B (Goal 3 – Technology Modernization): rolling 4-quarter view; split OpEx vs. CapEx; link each line to Roadmap/Initiative ID.? Segment A (Goals 4–5 – Transformation & Innovation): rolling 4-quarter + 1–2 year outlook; OpEx/CapEx split; decision flags; pre-approval field per line.Practical exampleSegment B budget: Q2–Q1 rolling table, OpEx/CapEx columns, each line shows Initiative ID, cost band, quarter, owner.Common pitfallsOne “master spreadsheet” for all segments • No OpEx/CapEx split for A/B • No initiative IDs (orphan lines).Concept #7: Budget Hygiene & Follow-Through SLAsWhy it mattersBudgets only drive approvals when the “decision moment” is explicit and the follow-through is fast.How to apply (plain rules)? Lead with a 1-page Budget Snapshot: totals by quarter, OpEx/CapEx split, top 3 risks, max two decisions.? Hygiene gate (same as QBR/proposals): count “expansion credit” only when Owner + Target date + Budget band are captured.? Recap ≤ 48h after the budget session; open CTAs with first action ≤ 72h.? Each budget line must link to a Roadmap/Initiative ID (no orphans).? Versioning: v1, v2… and a one-line change note (“Moved MFA to Q3 per audit window”).Practical example Approve Endpoint Refresh Phase 1 — Owner: Ops Dir; Target: Sep; Budget: $28–32k.Common pitfallsSnapshot missing • More than two asks • Recap next week • Lines not tied to roadmap.Concept #8: Budget Signals = Health SignalsWhy it mattersBudget movement reflects Engagement, Alignment, Adoption. Stalls are early churn indicators.How to apply (portfolio KPIs)? Time-to-first-action (CTA opened/owner set): target ≤ 72h.? Budget realization rate: % of budgeted initiatives that convert to approved proposals in-quarter.? Forecast vs. actual variance by quarter (±10–20% green / >20% investigate).? Pre-approval aging: >30 days stale ? re-engage/reset; >60 days ? re-sequence.? Decline reasons captured ≥ 90% (price, timing, relevance, dependency).Practical exampleSegment C: realization rate 40% for two quarters ? simplify scope, move one item to OpEx, re-frame “Why now”.Common pitfallsChasing stale pre-approvals • No decline reasons • Celebrating “verbal yes” without artifacts.
Implementation ProcessDevelop a structured, forward-looking budget that aligns with the client's maturity and appetite, enabling both parties to plan, prioritize, and commit with confidence.1. Collect the right inputs:? Use Discovery and Assessment findings to define initiatives? Include upcoming contract renewals, hardware replacements, and platform changes? Tag by category: CapEx, OpEx, lifecycle, compliance, etc.2. Structure the budget for client readiness:? Segment A/B or Level 4–5: multi-year plans with phase timing, pre-approval fields, and initiative notes? Segment C/D or Level 1–3: quarterly or semi-annual budgets with clear summaries and estimated ranges3. Embed into the CS lifecycle:? Link each item to the Roadmap and Proposal pipeline? Validate interest through informal price testing? Present during strategic meetings—not as a spreadsheet, but as a planning tool4. Use budgets to move from intention to action:? Confirm priorities and remove ambiguity? Enable faster proposal approvals? Track budget evolution over time as maturity growsDone right, a budget is not just a list of costs—it’s a strategic decision tool that connects investment insight and transforms planning into progress.
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?Budgets evolve in depth and strategic value alongside the client’s Business Goal level, driven by their maturity (standardization, visibility, and financial discipline) and appetite (willingness to invest in forward-looking change). Each level reflects a different budget role: from basic visibility to long-term co-planning.But budgets aren’t just about what the client spends—they clarify how strategic the relationship is, and what pace of investment is realistic. MSPs must align budget timelines and format to the client’s readiness. A low-appetite client needs simplicity and flexibility; a high-appetite client needs phased, roadmap-linked planning.At higher levels of maturity, clients also expect a clear separation between capital expenditures (CapEx, such as hardware or projects) and Operational Expenditures (OpEx, including licenses, services, and subscriptions). Reflecting both types in budget presentations signals financial professionalism and supports executive planning.This progression mirrors the broader CS process:? Discovery Intake identifies potential areas of change.? Assessment Intake validates readiness.? Reports clarify risks and the initiative's value.? Budgeting defines the timing, scope, and financial alignment of what happens next.LevelBudgeting Role and Scope1.1 Technology SupportBasic spend visibility. Covers recurring services, contracts, licenses, and overdue hardware. Used to avoid surprises and reinforce trust. Often manual or email-based.1.2 Technology EnablementAdds forecasting for short-term replacements and operational improvements. Helps shift budgeting from a reactive to a planned approach. Clients may begin recognizing patterns.1.3 Technology ModernizationIntroduces multi-period forecasts and “price testing” for projects—Aligns initiatives to lifecycle and platform changes. MSP uses the budget to validate interest before investing in deep planning.1.4 Business TransformationBudgets support roadmap execution. They include departmental initiatives, phased sequencing, and stakeholder approvals. Presentation format matters—it must guide decisions. Capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenditures (OpEx) are tracked and presented separately to support business justification and decision-making.1.5 Business InnovationBudgeting becomes a shared strategic process. The scope encompasses long-term investment themes, including AI, analytics, cloud architecture, and OKR-aligned initiatives. Includes pre-approvals and forward commitments. Budgets integrate CapEx and OpEx categories across multi-year views, supporting CFO-level alignment.Budgets are how MSPs translate ideas into investment timing. The further the client climbs the Business Goal pyramid, the more essential budgeting becomes to drive buy-in, pacing, and prioritization. It's not just a tool—it's a strategic discipline.How does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Client Business Goal – The budget scope adapts to the client's maturity and appetite. It gives a financial lens to goal progression.? 2. Customer Success Health – Transparent spend forecasting enhances customer experience and trust. Missed expectations or surprises erode sentiment.? 3. Customer Success Delivery – Budget data defines what gets proposed, when it’s affordable, and how execution is phased.? 4. Customer Success Process – Budgets are downstream of Initiative planning and upstream of proposal. They anchor meeting discussions.? 6. Customer Success People – TAMs, vCIOs, and CSMs utilize budgets to facilitate financial planning conversations with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.? 7. Customer Success Strategy – Budgets reflect the depth of engagement. Lower-touch = automated summaries. Higher-touch = consultative, phased forecasts.Product Links / Tooling SupportThe LMx Budget Forecast tool allows MSPs to:? Automatically generate client-specific forecasts based on:?

OverviewWhat is the objective?To define and communicate a coherent technology strategy for the client, based on their business objectives, digital maturity, and growth appetite. The strategy serves as the long-term compass, ensuring that tactical wins ultimately lead to strategic outcomes.Why is it important?Strategy bridges the gap between technical actions and business value. A well-articulated strategy:? Connects Discovery and Assessment findings to long-term vision? Aligns stakeholders across IT and business functions? Enables prioritization of initiatives based on impact and feasibility.? Creates buy-in for multi-phase improvements, especially in higher maturity segments.? Builds trust and clarity for sustained investmentAs an MSP, why do I need to do this?Executing projects without a shared strategy leads to fragmented value. A strong client strategy:? Positions your MSP as a strategic business partner? Creates continuity between the roadmap, proposal, and budget planning? Reduces churn and pricing pressure by demonstrating forward vision? Guides future planning—ensuring you know what to recommend, and when? Anchors technology workstreams to the client’s maturity and appetiteWhat is the Customer impact?Clients:? Gain a clear vision for how IT supports their business goals? Engage more confidently in budget and roadmap decisions? Feel guided, not just supported—especially at higher goal levels? Can align internal departments and timelines around a shared digital strategy
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Strategy Must Evolve by Segment, Maturity, and AppetiteA client’s technology strategy should never be one-size-fits-all. Strategic planning must reflect two key aspects: the client's current maturity level and their readiness to change (appetite). These two factors define the Client Business Goal level, which in turn informs:? Format – Clients in Segments A and B may expect a,complete co-branded strategic plan; clients in Segments C and D may benefit more from summary slides or roadmap commentary.? Depth – High-maturity and appetite clients (e.g., Goals 4–5) require a multi-year vision and initiative sequencing; lower levels (Goals 1–2) need just enough direction to avoid reactive cycles.? Cadence – Strategic conversations may occur quarterly, annually, or at key roadmap inflection points, depending on the segment and engagement rhythm. In short, strategy delivery must evolve in tandem with the client. The more mature and committed they become, the more valuable— and expected —your strategic guidance will be.Use a segment map to set format depth: D = embedded notes, C = project plan + milestones, B = initiative map + roadmap summary, A = co-branded multi-year plan.Concept #2: Strategy Is Synthesized—and Best Delivered LiveEffective strategies are not invented in isolation. They are crafted from what Discovery and Assessment reveal, what the Budget can support, and what the Roadmap needs to communicate. Strategy connects the dots:? Discovery = Why the client wants to change? Assessment = Where they are exposed or behind? Roadmap = How improvements can be sequenced? Budget = What’s feasible and justifiableBut the power of strategy lies in the delivery, not just the document. A strategy must be reviewed and discussed live with the client. That’s how objections surface, timelines align, and buy-in is secured. Never treat strategy as an output—treat it as a conversation.These live conversations also offer the best opportunity to validate CS Health signals. When the strategy is reviewed, Engagement patterns, Alignment gaps, or Appetite shifts can be observed and logged to refine scoring and follow-up actions.For Segments A/B, target live delivery ≥80%; for C/D, allow async delivery with a short video recap, then schedule a brief decision check-in.Concept #3: Strategy Aligns the Entire CS LifecycleStrategy gives meaning and continuity to every CS deliverable. It is:? The bridge between Discovery and the Roadmap? The business case that backs your Proposal? The narrative lens for your Executive Report? The context that gives your Budget credibility If CS is a chain, strategy is the thread that connects each link. It ensures the client doesn’t see disjointed projects or reports, but rather a coordinated plan with a clear direction.This coherence is critical for CS Health scoring, especially Alignment. A clearly communicated strategy ensures each tactical move is part of a broader, visible plan. Misalignment in Health scoring often reflects a breakdown in strategy delivery or visibility.Concept #4: A Good Strategy Makes Budget Conversations EasierMost clients hesitate to invest without a reason. Strategy gives them that reason. When done well, your strategic plan:? Shows how initiatives ladder up to business goals? Breaks large programs into digestible phases? Justifies timing, investment, and outcomes with clear logicThis is especially important in the Proposal ? Budget ? Approval cycle. A strategy-backed roadmap gives sales and vCIOs the talking points they need to secure commitment. And it reduces pushback, because the story has already been co-written.Budget, Health and Initiative follow-through become stronger when strategy is used as the financial justification engine. Strategic framing supports CS Health by tying each investment to business impact, which reinforces Adoption, Alignment, and Engagement metrics.Include early price testing for each near-term theme (cost band) and capture pre-approval (Owner + Quarter + Budget band) to speed Proposal creation.Concept #5: Strategic Planning Is a Team SportStrategy shouldn’t live in a silo. It must be shared across the CS team:? vCIOs guide the vision and manage executive alignment? CSMs reinforce it during day-to-day engagement.? TAMs and Engineers execute initiatives with the strategy in mindWhen everyone knows the direction, tactical work becomes part of a bigger story. That improves morale, sharpens communication, and ensures that each team member understands how their role contributes to the client’s long-term success.It also ensures that CS Health scores—especially Service Quality and Execution—are supported by a shared internal framework. Standardized strategy sharing reduces role drift, protects against misalignment, and enhances the quality of governance reviews.Keep a mini-RACI: vCIO owns the narrative (A/B), CSM co-drives (B/C), AM handles renewals/budget signals, TAM provides readiness inputs.Concept #6: Strategy = 1-page Snapshot + two decisions (delivered live)Why it mattersStrategy lands when decisions are made. A long strategy deck only works if it’s led by a 1-page, decision-first summary.How to apply (plain rules)? Start every strategy session with a 1-page Strategy Snapshot: Business goals/OKRs; mini Health (CX/Engagement/Adoption/Quality/Alignment); top 3 themes/risks; max two decisions (Why this / Why now / Expected impact / Owner & target date).? Deliver live for Segments A/B (target ≥80%). C/D: async deck + 2–3 min summary video, then a short Q&A follow-up.? Count “expansion credit” only when Owner + Target date + Budget band are captured.? Recap ≤48h (standard template). Open decision CTAs with first action ≤72h.Practical example “Approve Data Retention Policy rollout — Why now: audit; Impact: risk?; Owner: CFO; Target: Q3; Budget: $5–7K.”Common pitfallsMissing snapshot • 5+ asks in one session • Recap sent a week later • No CTA/owner.Concept #7: Strategy Hygiene & Freshness (keep it current, tie to roadmap)Why it mattersStrategy must be a living document—when it goes stale, Alignment and Engagement suffer.How to apply (portfolio guardrails)? Freshness: Strategy reviewed ≤120 days for A/B; ≤180 days for C; D = annual/trigger-based.? Traceability: Every strategy theme must map to a Roadmap/Initiative ID (no orphans).? Versioning: v1, v2… + 1-line change note (“Moved MFA to Q3 due to audit window”).? Health hooks: In each review, note Health deltas and open CTAs for any red/yellow theme.? KPIs: Strategy presented live (A/B) ≥80%; Recap ≤48h ≥95%; First-action ≤72h ≥95%; % themes with roadmap link = 100%.Common pitfalls “Once-a-year deck” • Themes not linked to the roadmap • No change log.
Implementation ProcessTurning Strategy into a Repeatable Customer Success MotionThe Strategy Implementation Process enables MSPs to translate Discovery and Assessment findings into a clear, business-aligned technology strategy—tailored by client segment, maturity, and appetite. This process ensures that strategy is not treated as a static document, but as an active planning and communication tool embedded in the cadence of Customer Success.The objective is to make strategic planning:? Scalable across segments? Integrated across CS Process and CS Delivery? Deliverable by any enabled CS role? Visible through CS Health metricsStep 1: Structure Strategy by Segment and Goal LevelUse segmentation (1.1) and the client's Business Goal level to define the format, depth, and cadence of strategic planning:SegmentGoal LevelStrategy FormatCadenceA4–5Co-branded multi-year strategic planQuarterly review, annual refreshB3–4Initiative map + roadmap summaryQuarterlyC2–3Project planning + milestone notesSemi-annualD1–2Optional; embedded in roadmapAnnual (if any)Strategy at Segment A becomes a living document; at Segment D it may simply be a roadmap comment.Step 2: Connect Strategy to the CS Process LifecycleUse outputs from each CS Process blueprint to inform and justify strategic framing:? Discovery (4.2): Identify business context, priorities, and constraints? Assessment (4.3): Define gaps, exposures, and readiness? Initiatives (4.5): Package improvements into scoped outcomes? Budget (3.3): Ensure strategy matches financial feasibility? Roadmap (3.5): Align strategic objectives to milestone trackingThen deliver strategy via a live Quarterly Meeting (4.4) where the client can confirm direction, adjust timing, and validate prioritization.Step 3: Assign Ownership and Standardize FormatEach strategy document or slide should be owned and delivered by the appropriate role based on segment:? vCIO / Strategic Advisor: Owns strategic content and presentation (Segment A/B)? CSM / AM: Supports narrative and initiative alignment (Segment B/C)? TAM / SDM: May reference strategic themes but do not lead strategy delivery (Segment C/D)Use playbooks (1.3) and standard templates by segment to ensure consistency in:? Structure (e.g., Executive Summary ? Current State ? Initiatives ? Timeline ? Goals)? Language (business-aligned, free from technical jargon)? Visuals (OKRs, budget ties, Health metrics)Step 4: Embed Strategy in CS Health, Governance, and Role Execution? Tie CS Health Alignment scores to strategic clarity and follow-through? Validate Engagement through strategy session attendance and contribution? Score Adoption through initiative uptake and alignment to strategic roadmapGovernance (5.5) should review:? Is the strategy up to date?? Was it presented in the last QBR?? Are initiatives and budget aligned to the plan?? Is the client moving toward their stated business goals?This turns strategy into a measurable, reviewable CS discipline—not just a deck.Step 5: Link to Proposal and Budget ExecutionA good strategy makes downstream execution easier. Ensure:? Proposals (3.2) directly reference strategic themes and expected outcomes? Budgets (3.3) reflect strategy pacing and investment alignment? Roadmaps (3.5) evolve as strategy matures or priorities shiftBy embedding strategy into planning tools, MSPs increase initiative conversion, client trust, and forecast reliability.Final Output: A Segmented, Live Strategy SystemAt the end of this process, every client should have:? A strategic framing aligned to their maturity, appetite, and segment? A defined update and review rhythm? A shared understanding of how tactical initiatives support long-term outcomesThis is how strategy becomes more than a deliverable. It becomes the narrative backbone of Customer Success—one that links insight, investment, and impact.

OverviewWhat is the objective?To visualize and communicate the timing, priority, and cost of current and future technology initiatives in alignment with the client’s business strategy. Roadmaps help clients understand not just what needs to happen, but when and why.Why is it important?? Clarifies which projects and improvements are planned for the future.? Helps clients prepare for workload, cost, and organizational impact.? Prevents initiative overload or poor sequencing.? Strengthens CS credibility by showing a proactive, long-term vision.? Connects recommendations to real business value and operational timing.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Provides a tangible way to organize, prioritize, and communicate initiatives.? Helps ensure that proposed projects are scheduled in a manageable and fundable sequence.? Reinforces CS value by tying initiatives to the client’s maturity and appetite, reflecting their Client Business Goal progression over time.? Enables better internal coordination across CS, Projects, Sales, and Procurement teams.What is the Customer impact?? Clients gain confidence from a clear, forward-looking plan for improvements.? Enables resource planning, change management, and financial forecasting.? Reduces friction and last-minute decision-making for strategic projects.? Provides visibility for stakeholders across departments to align on priorities.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: A Roadmap Is a Story Told Over TimeA roadmap isn’t just a list—it’s the visual narrative of how strategic change unfolds. It answers not only what should happen, but when and why. Effective roadmaps organize multiple initiatives into time-based themes that reflect business relevance, risk urgency, and resource capacity.They help clients and internal teams move from isolated projects to coordinated progress, showing how Discovery, Assessment, and Strategy translate into sequenced action.A strong roadmap:? Clarifies initiative timing across quarters or years? Prevents overload by spreading work and investment? Communicates priority at a glance? Sets expectations for future planning and budgetingDone well, it becomes the centrepiece of the CS engagement cycle, returning in every proposal, meeting, and QBR.It also becomes a core CS Health artifact—validating Alignment, Adoption planning, and Execution capacity. A roadmap without movement over time signals stagnation and should trigger a review of underlying Health metrics.Use three lanes to keep the story readable: Stability (risk/lifecycle), Efficiency (enablement/automation), Growth (innovation/OKR-linked).Concept #2: Roadmaps Must Flex with Segment, Maturity, and AppetiteThe roadmap format, complexity, and planning cadence should align with the client’s maturity (how well they operate) and appetite (how willing they are to improve). This reflects their Client Business Goal level, which determines:? Segment A–B (Goal 4–5) ? Multi-year vision tied to OKRs and department initiatives? Segment C–D (Goal 1–3) ? Short-term prioritization, lifecycle upgrades, or reactive supportIn other words, don’t overwhelm a Segment D client with a 2-year innovation plan—or deliver a one-liner to a CFO-backed innovation team. Roadmaps must earn trust by aligning with business ambitions. This ensures the roadmap is seen as relevant, not theoretical.It also ensures CS Health signals are interpreted correctly. A minimal roadmap may be appropriate for a low-maturity client, but a similar roadmap in Segment A would likely indicate misalignment or low Engagement.Set depth by segment: D = lifecycle board only, C = 1–2 quarter view, B = 12-month view, A = multi-year, department-tagged.Concept #3: Roadmaps Align All CS DeliverablesThink of the roadmap as a canvas that organizes everything else:? Reports explain progress along the roadmap? Proposals justify spending based on roadmap priorities? Budgets reflect roadmap timing and financial weight? Meetings check alignment against the roadmapThis coordination builds credibility, avoids overlap, and ensures each CS touchpoint adds value.It also supports CS Health review—offering a single frame where Engagement rhythm, Adoption status, and Service Quality outcomes are visibly linked to a structured plan.When clients see every recommendation fitting into a larger plan, their confidence in execution grows.Gate proposal ‘credit’ on roadmap placement + quarter; every Proposal/Budget line must reference a Roadmap ID.Concept #4: Roadmaps Improve Buy-In by Reducing SurpriseOne of the biggest reasons clients delay approvals is a lack of context. The roadmap solves this by making plans visible and predictable. When initiatives are mapped ahead:? Clients can prepare resources and a budget? Department heads are looped in earlier? Sales, tech, and CS can collaborate on timingEven if priorities shift, the roadmap provides a shared reference point.That shared reference point is also essential for sustaining CS Health during change. If Engagement or Alignment scores drop, the roadmap helps clarify where expectations or planning may have broken down.It provides clients with a mental model to say yes, and CS teams with a structure for managing timing, dependencies, and workload.Show early price bands on near-term items and capture pre-approval (Owner + Quarter + Budget band) during roadmap reviews.Concept #5: Roadmaps Should Be Interactive, Not StaticA great roadmap isn’t a PDF—it’s a working tool that can:? Drag and drop initiatives across quarters? Update status as progress occurs? Export timeline-specific reports for meetings or budgetsWhen roadmaps are easy to update and share, they become an integral part of everyday planning, not just a one-time presentation. This interactivity is key to operationalizing CS Health. When roadmap status aligns with initiative execution and cadence reviews, Health scores stay current, explainable, and governance-ready.That’s how CS teams scale strategic conversations across roles and clients.Require drag-and-drop re-sequencing live in the meeting; export the snapshot for the recap, not a static PDF deck.Concept #6: Roadmaps Should Surface Gaps as Well as PlansRoadmaps aren’t just about what’s happening—they’re also about what’s missing. If a roadmap lacks security initiatives or modernization steps, that becomes a topic for discussion. If too many high-cost items cluster in one quarter, you can re-sequence them. By surfacing these gaps:? CS teams anticipate pushback before it happens? Clients appreciate the transparency? Planning becomes proactive, not reactiveThis makes roadmap review not just a project tracker, but a strategic touchpoint as well.It also supports CS Health scoring by identifying where missing or stalled roadmap items suggest underlying issues in Adoption, Execution, or Engagement, allowing for early intervention.Run a gap scan each review: no orphan quarters, no missing security items, and ≤2 big rocks/quarter.Concept #7: Decision-first Roadmap = 1-page Snapshot + two decisionsWhy it mattersRoadmaps drive momentum when they surface decisions, not just timelines. A long board or deck lands best when it’s led by a 1-page, decision-first snapshot.How to apply (plain rules)? Start every review with a 1-page Roadmap Snapshot: Business outcomes; mini Health (CX/Engagement/Adoption/Quality/Alignment); next 2 quarters at a glance; max two decisions (Why this / Why now / Expected impact / Owner & target date).? Segments A/B: present live (target ≥80%). C/D: async board + 2–3 min summary video, then short Q&A.? Count expansion credit only when Owner + Target date + Budget band are captured.? Recap ≤48h (standard template). Open decision CTAs with first action ≤72h.Practical example “Approve Endpoint Refresh Q3 — Why now: warranty risk; Impact: downtime?; Owner: COO; Target: 09/30; Budget: $18–22K.”Common pitfallsEndless backlogs • No explicit “asks” • Recap a week later • CTAs without owners.Concept #8: Roadmap Hygiene & Freshness (keep it live, tie to initiatives)Why it mattersA stale roadmap erodes Alignment and Engagement. Hygiene rules keep it trusted and actionable.How to apply (portfolio guardrails)? Freshness: Reviewed ≤120 days for A/B; ≤180 days for C; D annual/trigger-based.? Traceability: Every roadmap item maps to an Initiative/Proposal ID (no orphans).? Versioning: v1, v2… + 1-line change note (“Moved MFA to Q3 due to audit window”).? Capacity guardrail: Max 2 “big rocks”/quarter; push the rest to next periods.? Health hooks: Note Health deltas each review; open CTAs for any red/yellow theme.? KPIs: Snapshot present ≥95%; Recap ≤48h ≥95%; First-action ≤72h ≥95%; % items linked to Initiative/Proposal = 100%.Common pitfalls “Once-a-year roadmap” • Items not linked to initiatives • Overloaded quarters • No change log.
Implementation ProcessMaking the Roadmap the Centerpiece of Strategic CS DeliveryThe Roadmap Implementation Process enables MSPs to transform disconnected initiatives into a coordinated, time-based strategic plan. It provides the client with visibility into what’s coming, why it matters, and when it will happen—while giving the MSP a practical way to manage pacing, dependencies, and stakeholder alignment.This process ensures that roadmaps are:? Tailored to client segment and Business Goal level? Embedded into CS Process, Delivery, and Health workflows? Owned and updated collaboratively across roles? Presented not as static documents, but as live planning toolsStep 1: Align Roadmap Format with Segment and Client Goal LevelUse segmentation and maturity scoring to select the right level of complexity and frequency for roadmap creation and review:SegmentGoal LevelRoadmap DepthUpdate RhythmA4–5Multi-year, cross-departmental viewQuarterlyB3–412-month view with quarterly pacingQuarterlyC2–3Short-term (1–2 quarter) outlookQuarterly or Semi-AnnualD1–2Minimal (lifecycle updates only)AnnualRoadmaps must feel ambitious to Segment A and achievable to Segment D—never generic.Step 2: Source Roadmap Content from Core CS Process InputsBuild the roadmap using structured inputs from CS Process deliverables:? Discovery (4.2): Capture business priorities and change signals? Assessment (4.3): Identify risks, gaps, and readiness? Initiatives (4.5): Translate insights into phased actions? Proposals (3.2): Insert scoped, budget-ready projects? Budget (3.3): Confirm initiative pacing and investment feasibility? Strategy (3.4): Use roadmap as a visual summary of the strategic planThis creates a closed-loop roadmap system that reflects both technical needs and business ambition.Step 3: Build the Roadmap Using Role-Based OwnershipEach roadmap must have a clear internal owner and contributor model:? vCIO / Strategic Advisor: Owns roadmap narrative and executive delivery? CSM / AM: Manages updates, initiative tracking, and follow-up? TAM / SDM: Supports input for technical tasks, project milestones, and resource sequencingUse standardized templates for each segment to define:? Time horizon (e.g., 1-year, 2-year)? Initiative format (title, scope, owner, cost, status)? Strategic tags (e.g., AI, Security, Productivity, Lifecycle)Embed roadmap ownership into role charters to ensure accountability for movement.Step 4: Use the Roadmap as a Strategic Planning and Review ArtifactThe roadmap must be part of the client cadence—not a one-off deliverable. Integrate it into:? Quarterly Business Reviews (4.4): Use as the centerpiece for strategic alignment? Proposal Conversations: Ensure each new initiative fits into an existing or evolving roadmap? Budget Forecasting: Align roadmap phases with known budget constraints or approval cyclesIf a roadmap is missing or unchanged for more than two quarters, treat it as a CS Health warning—indicating potential Engagement, Alignment, or Adoption risk.Step 5: Enable Roadmap Execution via Health and Governance SystemsRoadmaps are tracked not just for delivery—but for signal strength:? CS Health Alignment: Confirm that roadmap milestones match stated business goals? CS Health Adoption: Review initiative status and velocity over time? Governance (5.5): Conduct quarterly roadmap audits to assess delivery quality and client alignment? Reporting (3.1): Reference roadmap progress in Executive ReportsThis turns the roadmap into a living strategic system, with direct implications for client retention and strategic trust.Final Output: A Segment-Calibrated, Cadence-Driven Roadmap SystemWhen this process is complete, each client should have:? A roadmap appropriate to their segment and business goals? A defined rhythm for review and adjustment? A clear link between roadmap items and proposals, budgets, and CS Health signalsThis is how MSPs ensure the roadmap is not just a plan—but a strategic platform that powers momentum, reinforces value, and scales with client maturity.

?? 4. CS Process
4. CS Process[5][6]4. CS ProcessExecuting Customer Success with Structure and ConsistencyCS Process includes five key blueprints:4.1 Scheduling / Trigger4.2 Discovery Intake4.3 Assessment Intake4.4 Meeting4.5 Initiative (Projects)In SummaryExecuting Customer Success with Structure and ConsistencyThe CS Process discipline defines how Customer Success is executed—when engagements occur, what they include, and how they evolve across maturity levels. It connects strategic intent (Client Goals, CS Health, and Deliverables) with repeatable execution patterns.Process ensures that no client falls through the cracks and that every action, from Discovery to Roadmap delivery, is anchored in the client’s actual business posture, not just a calendar. It enables MSPs to scale engagement, reduce variability, and drive meaningful outcomes, regardless of client segment or CSM capacity.“Process is what ensures nothing slips through the cracks. It turns good intentions into repeatable results.”As clients move up the maturity and appetite quadrant, the CS Process must evolve. Reactive support transforms into insight-driven rhythms. Tactical meetings give way to co-planned initiatives. The CS Process discipline is what keeps the entire CS ecosystem moving in sync—from Discovery to Proposal to Budget—anchored in business relevance.CS Process includes five key blueprints:4.1 Scheduling / TriggerWhat it is: The framework for determining when CS engagements occur and what triggers them is based on cadence, CS Health signals, or business events.How it evolves: From manual check-ins ? to fixed cadences ? to triggered engagements aligned with roadmap reviews, health score changes, or initiative milestones.Why it matters:? Prevents inconsistent engagement and late interventions? Enables just-in-time meetings that reflect business reality? Aligns CS team effort to actual client needs and behaviourHow it connects to the Client Business Goal levels: Segment D clients may need biannual cadences; Segment A clients require monthly reviews tied to roadmaps and KPIs. Scheduling aligns engagement rhythm with quadrant-based priorities and appetite for planning.4.2 Discovery IntakeWhat it is: A structured method for uncovering business context, department needs, and strategic changes—before initiating reports, assessments, or proposals.How it evolves: From ad hoc conversations ? to standardized Discovery templates ? to segmented Discovery workflows based on maturity, appetite, and industry.Why it matters:? Surfaces client-side changes that affect the IT direction? Helps the MSP align technology with business priorities? Enables strategic relevance without requiring constant reinventionHow it connects to the Client Business Goal levels: Discovery uncovers readiness. It ensures MSPs understand where the client wants to go before recommending action. It’s especially critical as clients move from Enablement to Modernization and beyond.4.3 Assessment IntakeWhat it is: The structured scoring and intake of risk, readiness, or maturity across categories are tied directly to initiative design and prioritization.How it evolves: From asset inventories ? to category-based risk reviews ? to milestone-based assessments tied to transformation goals.Why it matters:? Creates objectivity and consistency in recommendations? Justifies project timing and initiative scope? Bridges technical insight with business planningHow it connects to the Client Business Goal levels: Assessment converts Discovery insights into structure. It’s how MSPs move from “what changed” to “what to do about it.” In high-maturity clients, assessments validate timing and investment. In lower segments, they clarify immediate risk.4.4 MeetingThe execution of strategic engagements typically covers Discovery insights, assessment findings, reports, roadmap alignment, and action planning.How it evolves: From issue-focused check-ins ? to QBR-style reviews ? to executive sessions focused on roadmap progress and initiative velocity.Why it matters:? Aligns stakeholders across business and IT? Reinforces trust through structured communication? Moves strategy forward by clarifying what’s nextHow it connects to the Client Business Goal levels: Meetings reflect segmentation. A Segment C meeting may focus on lifecycle risk and budgeting. A Segment A meeting is about OKR alignment and innovation planning. The format adapts, but the structure ensures consistency and progression.4.5 Initiative (Projects)What it is: The packaging of Discovery and Assessment outputs into scoped, named, and budgeted actions, ready for execution and tracking.How it evolves: From loosely defined follow-ups ? to ticketed actions ? to fully scoped initiatives with timelines, ROI framing, and approval triggers.Why it matters:? Turns insight into momentum? Makes value tangible and measurable? Enables roadmap-based delivery planningHow it connects to the Client Business Goal levels: Initiatives are the client’s transformation engine. For lower-maturity clients, initiatives represent targeted fixes. For higher-maturity clients, they become business-aligned programs, defined by department, goal, and projected value.
Definitions: CS Process1. Scheduling/Trigger A clear plan and timeline defining exactly when meetings, reviews, or check-ins with clients should happen. Triggers are specific events or time-based rules that automatically prompt these activities, ensuring consistent and timely engagements.2. Discovery Intake A structured conversation with your client designed to uncover business goals, challenges, and changes. Discovery helps you truly understand what’s important to your client before recommending any actions or projects.3. Assessment Intake A methodical, detailed evaluation of a client's IT environment, focusing on key areas like security, technology adoption, and risk. It validates issues found in discovery, providing clear scores and findings for decision-making.4. Meeting Structured and scheduled sessions with your clients to discuss progress, address issues, and plan next steps. Meetings connect everything—from reports and assessments to proposals and budgets—turning insights into decisions and actions.5. Initiative (Projects) Clearly defined and scoped actions that come from assessments and discovery, designed to address specific problems or opportunities. Initiatives translate strategy into tasks that can be executed and tracked.6. Lifecycle Review A regular check to confirm the client's technology is up-to-date, secure, and aligned with industry standards and best practices. It ensures equipment, software, and services are refreshed at the right times, avoiding unnecessary risks or downtime.7. Quarterly Business Review (QBR) A regularly scheduled strategic meeting (usually quarterly) with the client to review progress, update roadmaps, and align on key business and technology priorities. QBRs help maintain momentum and strategic alignment.8. Health Review Session Meetings specifically focused on discussing customer health metrics (such as engagement, adoption, satisfaction) to identify any risks or opportunities. It ensures client relationships remain strong, healthy, and proactive.9. ClientIQ A structured approach to using data and client-specific insights (industry, business priorities, past engagements) to personalize your conversations, recommendations, and assessments, making them highly relevant and impactful.10. CS Rhythm The consistent, predictable schedule of customer success activities (meetings, reviews, initiatives) tailored to each client segment and maturity. It ensures every client gets the right level of attention and engagement at the right times.In SummaryCS Process is the operational core of the Customer Success system. It transforms goals and insights into scheduled, structured, and actionable workflows that scale. It adapts by segment, client behaviour, and engagement model—ensuring the right actions happen at the right time, in the right way.When fully implemented, the CS Process ensures:? Engagements happen predictably, but flexibly? Discovery and assessments are not skipped or rushed? Meetings drive alignment, not just activity?

OverviewWhat is the objective?To ensure that client-facing activities—especially strategic meetings—are consistently scheduled based on client segmentation, service tier, and business objectives. Triggers help standardize CS cadence, reduce manual effort, and surface missed opportunities.Why is it important?? Aligns meeting frequency and type with client maturity and appetite? Prevents missed engagements that lead to churn or stalled initiatives? Creates structure and accountability across Customer Success teams? Enables scalable CS delivery without losing personalizationAs an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Increases visibility into client meeting schedules across the team.? Ensures strategic meetings occur at the right frequency per segment (e.g. annual, quarterly).? Reinforces CS value by aligning touchpoints with the client’s maturity and appetite, and therefore their Client Business Goal.? Reduces time spent manually coordinating meetings or recovering from missed ones.What is the Customer impact?? Clients receive the right level of engagement based on their needs, not just reactively.? Builds trust and predictability through consistent communication.? Makes strategic planning more effective when meetings are timely and context-aware.? Reduces confusion and friction when meetings are well-prepared and follow a known rhythm.? Fewer “why are we meeting?” moments: every session arrives with a clear purpose, the last recap, two proposed decisions, and next steps—so approvals happen faster and meetings feel valuable.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Cadence matrix by segment = your metronome (one-pager)Context: Rhythm matters. Timing isn’t admin work; it’s a strategic lever. A clear, segment-based rhythm prevents “too late” or “too often” and keeps planning proactive, not reactive.Typical MSP cases solved? Meetings drift or bunch up at quarter-end; critical reviews happen “when we have time.”? New CSMs/AMs “inherit” chaos; no one knows what good cadence looks like.How to apply1. Publish a one-page cadence matrix in your playbook:? Segment A: Monthly strategy + Quarterly roadmap? Segment B: Quarterly strategy + Semi-annual budget? Segment C: Quarterly review or Semi-annual check-in? Segment D: Semi-annual or Annual operational sync2. Add guardrails to the invite template: agenda, 2 proposed decisions max, prior recap, Health snapshot.3. Track “Coverage Next 30 Days” per segment (target ≥90%).Practical examples? Segment B portfolio view shows QBRs evenly spread across the quarter; no month has >40% of B-segment meetings.Common pitfalls? “One-size-fits-all” cadence; too many exceptions; no scorecard KPI for coverageConcept #2: The 6 triggers that actually scale cadence (date / event / health)Context: Triggers automate cadence. Define conditions (time, lifecycle, change) that automatically create the meeting/task.Typical MSP cases solved? CS spends hours chasing calendars; key sessions happen late or not at all.How to apply? Set six automation rules in PSA/CRM/CS tool. Each rule must create: owner, due-by, invite + prep pack, and a checklist.? Date-based1. Renewal window: planning call 90 days before renewal.2. Fiscal year: budget session 30 days before client year-end.? Event-based1. Assessment completed ? roadmap meeting +10 days.2. Initiative stage change (e.g., from Proposed?Approved) ? delivery kick-off.? Health-based1. Engagement drop (missed 2 touchpoints / no decision in 30 days) ? 30-min reset ≤7 days.2. Adoption below threshold (e.g., MFA<60% / endpoint<80%) ? TAM remediation sync ≤5 days. (Optional: Stakeholder change; Missed-SLA threshold.)Practical examples? After a Cyber assessment, CS tool creates a “Roadmap Validate” meeting for Day+10 with agenda + last recap attached.Common pitfalls? 10+ triggers (noise), triggers without due-by, or “team” as owner (no one acts).Concept #3: Owner-by-role mini-RACI for scheduling (who schedules, who prepares, who backs up)Context: Scheduling creates visibility and accountability across the team.Typical MSP cases solved? “Who owns this client’s cadence?” “Who sends the invite?” Silence.How to apply? Add Cadence Owner on each account (AM/CSM).? Consulted: vCIO (A/B strategy), TAM (C/D lifecycle).? Back-up: named per account; automatic reassignment during absence.? Scorecards: % on-time scheduling, exec sponsor seen ≤120 days coverage.Practical examples? If Cadence Owner is out, back-up receives auto task to send invites within 24h.Common pitfalls? “The team” listed as owner; no back-up; no scorecard linkage.Concept #4: Quality guardrails: prep pack + 2 decisions + recap ≤48hContext: Meetings are where deliverables converge; decisions move roadmaps; governance checks they happened.Typical MSP cases solved? Technically fine delivery but clients feel lost; QBRs log activity, not decisions.How to apply? Prep pack auto-attached to every strategic invite: 1-screen Business Outcomes Snapshot, last recap, Health snapshot, max two proposed decisions.? Track two KPIs: % meetings with recap ≤48h (≥95%); % meetings with ≥1 logged decision (≥70%).? Apply QBR credit gate: count expansion only if owner + date + budget are captured.Practical examples? Recap template: “What we decided / Why now / Owner & date / Risks / Next cadence.”Common pitfalls? Slide parades; “verbal approvals” with no artefact; skipping the recap.Concept #5: Capacity-aware scheduling for small teamsContext — kept from the current text: Cadence follows segmentation and signals investment; to scale, match rhythm to capacity (original “Cadence Follows Segmentation—and Signals Investment”). Typical MSP cases solved? vCIO calendar overloaded in Week 12; nothing earlier moved.How to apply? Set weekly slot limits: e.g., vCIO ≤8 strategic meetings/week; CSM batch days (Tue/Thu).? Enforce 80% rule to leave room for follow-ups and prep.? No double-booking; avoid all-hands Fridays.Practical examples? Portfolio view warns if a role is >90% booked next week; auto-rebalances B/C meetings.Common pitfalls? Hero mode scheduling; every day open for everything; ignoring prep time.Concept #6 — Missed-cadence recovery play (1 miss = reschedule; 2 miss = re-engage)Context — kept from the current text: Without Health tracking, cadence falls apart; use signals to protect the rhythm (original “Without Health Tracking, Cadence Falls Apart”).Typical MSP cases solved? Repeatedly skipped QBRs; engagement quietly decays.How to apply? 1 missed session ? auto-reschedule within 7 days.? 2 consecutive misses ? create CTA: Re-engage Stakeholders (First-Action SLA ≤72h).? 3 misses ? segmentation & cadence review; consider cadence downgrade or executive reset.Practical examples? Watchlist widget: “Past-due strategic sessions” with owner and next date.Common pitfalls? Treating misses as harmless; no escalation path; waiting for renewal to fix it.Concept #7 — Portfolio radar: 20-minute weekly CS Ops (Past Due / Next 30 Days)Context: Health and cadence must be monitored as a system; leadership needs a line of sight.Typical MSP cases solved? Leaders find out about slipped cadences only when CX drops or renewal nears.How to apply? Run a 20-minute weekly CS Ops huddle:? Top 10 past-due strategic meetings; assign owners and dates.? Next 30 days load by role; rebalance if >90%.? Review trigger efficacy; retire noisy rules; tune thresholds.? Track time-to-first-action on cadence misses (≤72h target).Practical examples? Heatmap by segment (A/B/C/D) shows cadence coverage, recap ≤48h, exec sponsor seen ≤120 days.Common pitfalls? Only looking backwards; no CTA closure; never pruning bad triggers.
Implementation ProcessOperationalizing Strategic Cadence with TriggersThe Scheduling/Trigger Implementation Process ensures that all Customer Success (CS) engagements—especially strategic meetings—occur at the right time, with the right depth, for the right client. This cadence-based model replaces ad hoc coordination with a structured rhythm aligned to segmentation, business goals, and health metrics. It enables the CS system to scale while preserving personalization and strategic value.Step 1: Publish the Cadence Matrix + mini-RACI (one-time)What this adds: Before you start, publish a one-page matrix that lists the meeting rhythm per segment (A/B/C/D) and a mini-RACI for scheduling (Cadence Owner / Consulted / Back-up).Definition of Done: Matrix shared in your playbook; every account has a named Cadence Owner and Back-up.Default role map: A/B ? vCIO = Accountable; AM = Consulted; CSM/TAM = Consulted; Back-up = AM. C/D ? CSM = Accountable; TAM = Responsible; AM = Consulted; Back-up = TAM.Step 2: Define Cadence by Segment and Client Business Goal LevelBegin by assigning meeting frequency based on client maturity and appetite. Use segmentation and Business Goal levels to determine the rhythm:SegmentGoal LevelRecommended CadenceA5Monthly strategy + quarterly roadmapB3–4Quarterly strategy + semi-annual budgetC2–3Quarterly review or semi-annual check-inD1–2Semi-annual or ad hoc operational syncMatch cadence to:? Engagement strategy and initiative planning cycles? Reporting and budgeting rhythms? Stakeholder roles (e.g., vCIO vs. AM vs. CSM involvement)Strategic cadence is a resource signal. Over-servicing low-engagement clients wastes capacity; under-engaging high-value clients increases churn risk.Do this (practical):? Record the next strategic meeting date for every account according to the matrix.? Make cadence visible on a shared calendar/board.Definition of Done / KPI:? Portfolio “Next 30 days coverage” ≥ 90% (each account has a booked strategic session in the next 30 days).Step 3: Configure and Monitor Triggers to Automate SchedulingUse repeatable trigger conditions to schedule meetings and CS touchpoints:? Date-based triggers: Schedule based on calendar milestones like renewal dates, fiscal year-end, or roadmap checkpoints.1. Renewal ?90 days ? Schedule Renewal/Strategy review (+ auto-CTA).2. Fiscal year-end ?30 days ? Budget planning session (+ auto-CTA).? Event-based triggers: Initiate meetings after a completed Assessment, major incident, or key Discovery insight.3. Assessment completed +10 days ? Roadmap review (+ auto-CTA).5. Initiative Approved ? Delivery kick-off / handoff (+ auto-CTA).? Health-based triggers: Re-engage clients after Engagement or Adoption scores drop.5. Engagement drop (missed 2 touchpoints or no decision in 30 days) ? Re-engage session (+ auto-CTA).6. Adoption under threshold (e.g., MFA <60% or endpoint <80%) ? Remediation planning (+ auto-CTA).For each client, define:? Meeting types (Strategic Review, Roadmap Sync, Budget Planning)? Roles required (TAM, AM, vCIO)? Prep requirements (Reports, Assessments, Proposals)These triggers reduce friction, reinforce strategic structure, and help managers oversee cadence consistency.Practical rule: ? Every trigger auto-creates (a) the meeting invite and (b) a CTA with owner + due date (first-action SLA ≤ 72h).? Manual fallback: If automation isn’t available, every trigger lands in a Trigger Queue table; it’s processed in Weekly CS Ops – Cadence Radar; first-action SLA ≤ 72h still applies.Definition of Done / KPIs: ? Trigger coverage = 100% (each active client has the six triggers configured or appears in the manual queue); Trigger first-action ≤ 72h ≥ 95%.? Monthly trigger smoke-test completed (all six fires at least once in the sandbox or on a pilot account).Step 4: Align Scheduling with Deliverables and Strategic MilestonesCadence is only effective when timed with meaningful client-facing content. Ensure each scheduled meeting is:? Anchored to content: Initiatives, Reports, Budgets, Assessments? Role-aware: Tailored to executive, operational, or tactical audiences? Health-informed: Adjusted based on CS Health trends, appetite shifts, or maturity changesScheduling is not a calendar exercise—it is a trigger for momentum. This alignment turns every scheduled meeting into a launchpad for execution.Meeting Quality Guardrails (keep it simple):? Prep pack attached to the invite: 1-screen Business Outcomes Snapshot + Health snapshot.? Bring max 2 decisions (two asks) to each strategic meeting.? Send recap ≤ 48h using your standard template.? Apply the QBR credit gate before counting expansion (owner + date + budget).Definition of Done / KPIs:? Recap ≤ 48h ≥ 95%; ≥1 logged decision ≥ 70% of strategic meetings.? % meetings with prep pack attached ≥ 95%.Step 5: Track Cadence Execution and Adjust Based on PerformanceUse cadence logs, segment filters, and meeting history to flag overdue clients, identify risk, and adjust frequency based on maturity or initiative velocity.Implement governance checkpoints:? Are strategic meetings occurring on time by segment?? Are preparation materials delivered consistently?? Are Engagement and Alignment scores reflecting meeting quality?Add three lightweight routines:1. Weekly CS Ops “Cadence Radar” (20 min)? Review Past due, Next 30 days, and noisy triggers; rebalance load by role.? Output: updated invites, cleared blockers, clean trigger queue.2. Missed-Cadence Recovery Play? 1 miss ? auto-rebook ≤ 7 days.? 2 in a row ? Re-engage CTA (first-action ≤ 72h).? 3 in a row ? segmentation/cadence review at the next governance check.3. Capacity Guardrails for small teams? Weekly slot limits per role (e.g., vCIO ≤ 8 strategic sessions/week).? Use “batch days” for strategic meetings; keep average role load <85%.Definition of Done / Portfolio KPIs:? Past-due trend ?; Exec sponsor seen coverage (≤120 days): A/B ≥ 90%, C/D ≥ 75%. ?; role load <85%.Final Output: A Structured, Scalable Engagement RhythmAt the end of this process, every client should have a segment-appropriate cadence with visible meeting triggers; engagements are timely, role-specific, and tied to outcomes; CS Health improves as rhythm stabilizes.Shared KPI set (track monthly):? Coverage (Next 30 days) ≥ 90%? Recap ≤ 48h ≥ 95%? Time-to-First-Action on trigger CTAs ≤ 72h? Exec sponsor “seen” coverage (≤120 days)? ≥1 logged decision ≥ 70% of strategic meetings? Count of past-due strategic meetings (downward trend)30–60–90 Day Rollout (small CS team)? Days 1–30: Step 0–2 live (matrix, mini-RACI, 6 triggers); Coverage ≥ 80%.? Days 31–60: Step 3 + 4a live (guardrails + weekly radar); Recap ≤48h ≥ 90%.? Days 61–90: Step 4b–4c live (recovery + capacity); KPIs stable; fine-tune thresholds.

OverviewWhat is the objective?To uncover recent or upcoming changes in the client’s business environment by asking structured, high-value questions across Business, Enablement, and Technology dimensions. Discovery Intake is the first and most segment-aware strategic intake—it sets the direction for all future customer service (CS) actions.Why is it important?Discovery is the starting point of every strategic customer service (CS) engagement. It helps MSPs move beyond tickets and reports by exploring what the client values. Its structure, depth, and format must align with the client's segment, Business Goal level, and engagement cadence. The goal isn’t to track change for its own sake, but to deeply understand: ? What outcomes matter to the client ? What’s holding them back ? How to bridge technology and business objectives. This opens the door to relevance and positions the MSP as a business advisor. When ambiguity or misalignment is uncovered, the next step is to narrow the scope with a structured Assessment. This is the Inverted Bow Tie model: Discovery opens the scope, Assessment closes it. As an MSP, why do I need to do this?Because strategic partnerships aren’t built on assumptions. Discovery Intake provides the critical visibility and strategic context that informs CS Health scoring, Client Business Goal segmentation, and playbook activation. It also helps overcome the discomfort MSPs often feel when shifting from technical comfort zones to business dialogue. Done correctly: ? Discovery becomes a segment-aware playbook, not just a loose conversation ? Timing and depth sync with Engagement Strategy and scheduling triggers ? Initiatives, Reports, Proposals, and Budgets all start from here What is the Customer impact?Clients feel truly understood, not just supported. When Discovery is done right:? Conversations shift from systems to strategy? Priorities become clearer, faster? Planning becomes collaborative, not prescriptive. Clients in high-maturity or strategic segments expect structured, proactive discovery sessions. Clients in lower-touch tiers may benefit from shorter, more focused formats.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Discovery Is a Segment-Aware PlaybookDiscovery isn’t one-size-fits-all—it’s how you show clients you understand their time, context, and growth potential. Segment A clients might expect multi-stakeholder strategy sessions. Segment C or D might just need a brief conversation or an async form. The proper format depends on the client’s maturity (how standardized and scalable their tech is) and appetite (how willing they are to engage and improve). These two factors define their Client Business Goal level, which shapes the tone, depth, and structure of your Discovery. Done right, Discovery earns trust by respecting the client's stage and making your questions feel relevant, not random.It also provides essential inputs into CS Health scoring, surfacing early indicators of Engagement strength, Alignment potential, and even shifts in client appetite. These signals should be captured and fed into the CS Health system for trend analysis and prioritization.Concept #2: Sync Discovery to Engagement CadenceDiscovery works best when it’s built into your rhythm, not bolted on as an extra. Whether it’s part of a quarterly roadmap review or tied to an annual renewal, use your Engagement Strategy to determine how often Discovery should happen—and your Scheduling/Trigger tools to make it automatic. Done right, Discovery becomes a habit that keeps CS aligned and insightful.More importantly, regular Discovery becomes a structural CS Health safeguard, ensuring that Alignment and Engagement trends don’t drift over time. It helps MSPs proactively surface change signals before they become risk events.Concept #3: Ask Across Three Dimensions—Don’t Just Talk TechDiscovery isn’t about diving straight into patch schedules or backups. To add value, you need a 360° view of the business. That means exploring three core dimensions:? Business Topics – What are the client’s goals, growth plans, or upcoming challenges?? Enablement Topics – Where Are Processes Stuck? What’s slowing down teams or departments?? Technology Topics – What infrastructure risks or opportunities are emerging?A well-rounded Discovery balances all three. If you skip the business or process side, you’ll miss the context behind tech needs. And if you only discuss technology, your conversations remain stuck in the past, rather than planning for the future.These three areas feed directly into CS Health metrics: Business and Enablement topics often reveal Alignment opportunities, while Technology topics may point to Adoption gaps or Service Quality risks. Discovery makes these dimensions visible and trackable.Concept #4: Discovery Builds Trust—If You Show Up to Learn, Not SellDiscovery only works when it feels safe and valuable for the client. That means showing up with curiosity, not a hidden agenda. Start every session by making your intent clear: “We’re here to learn, not to pitch. The better we understand what’s changing, the better we can support you.”This slight shift breaks down defences and opens the door to honest answers. Clients become collaborators, not targets.Skip the sales pitch. Lead with questions. Then listen. That’s how Discovery becomes the start of something strategic, not just another meeting.These early-stage signals of openness and responsiveness are meaningful contributors to Engagement Health. Governance and Enablement should both ensure that CS teams are trained and measured on Discovery quality, not just completion.Concept #5: Discovery Prepares the Ground for Everything ElseDiscovery is the one part of the CS process where you don’t need to fix anything—you just need to listen. It’s not about providing answers; it’s about surfacing the right questions. When you slow down, let the client speak, and ask open-ended, layered questions, you uncover the deeper “why” behind their needs—the part they may not even know how to articulate.That “why” becomes the foundation for everything else: better assessments, clearer proposals, smoother approvals. Discovery isn’t the project—it’s the prep work that makes every future step easier.Think of it like gardening: you don’t plant strategy into hard soil. You still get it first. Discovery is how you earn trust, reduce surprises, and prepare clients to say yes when it matters most.It's also where CS Health measurement starts. If Discovery is skipped or shallow, every downstream metric—Engagement, Alignment, and Adoption—becomes distorted.Concept #6: Do’s and Don’ts of Discovery ConversationsDiscovery isn’t a script—it’s a mindset. Clients don’t want a checklist; they want to feel understood. That’s why the best Discovery conversations feel natural, not clinical. You’re not cross-examining them—you’re uncovering what matters, together.Do:? Ask open-ended questions across Business, Enablement, and Technology topics.? Tailor language to the client’s role, industry, and comfort level.? Listen for signs of change, such as new hires, shifting goals, or emerging roadblocks.? Summarize what you hear and show how you’ll use that insight.? Tag Discovery insights as inputs into CS Health, especially where appetite, risk, or value alignment are discussed.Don’t:? Jump into initiatives or solutions too early.? Stick rigidly to a template without adapting to the client’s mood or responses.? Ask only about services you already deliver—it limits the conversation to the past.? Skip the notes. If you don’t document it, it didn’t happen.? Ignore weak or absent Discovery signals—they can forecast future CS Health degradation, and should trigger Governance follow-up.A great Discovery feels like a thoughtful conversation, not a disguised sales pitch. It builds relevance, reveals opportunity, and sets the tone for a collaborative future.And when captured consistently, it feeds the CS Health system with the most reliable data on client change, intent, and alignment.
Implementation ProcessMaking Discovery Intake Strategic and RepeatableThe Discovery Implementation Process transforms casual client check-ins into structured, segment-aware conversations that reveal business priorities, uncover hidden risks, and guide downstream Customer Success actions. This process ensures Discovery is not ad hoc—it becomes the insight engine for CS Health, segmentation, initiative planning, and strategic alignment.This process enables:? Structured Discovery conversations across all segments? Role-based ownership and preparation? Systematic documentation and integration with CS Process and CS HealthStep 1: Prepare Strategically by Segment and Goal LevelUse Segmentation (1.1) and the client’s Business Goal level to define the depth, frequency, and delivery format of Discovery:SegmentGoal LevelFormatFrequencyA4–5Multi-stakeholder strategy sessionQuarterlyB3–4Guided Discovery during QBRQuarterly or Semi-AnnualC2–3Structured 1:1 or async formSemi-AnnualD1–2Lightweight intakeAnnual or Trigger-BasedPre-Discovery preparation should include:? Reviewing CS Health trends, ticket history, and roadmap status? Checking recent changes in leadership, operations, or priorities? Setting a Discovery objective (e.g., roadmap intake, renewal, initiative planning)Step 2: Guide the Discovery Conversation Across 3 DimensionsStructure each conversation to touch on three dimensions:? Business Topics – Goals, constraints, metrics, growth initiatives? Enablement Topics – Operational friction, process gaps, collaboration bottlenecks? Technology Topics – Stack risks, system misalignments, upcoming lifecycle eventsUse open-ended, client-appropriate language tailored to their segment and maturity level. Avoid jumping to solutions—focus on understanding first.If clients reveal actionable needs or appetite for change, tag the insight for Assessment (4.3) or Initiative intake (4.5).Capture:? Key business drivers and constraints? Stakeholder context (who’s involved, who owns what)? Any signs of change in maturity or appetiteStep 3: Translate Discovery into Action and IntegrationAfter the conversation, document and categorize insights:? Tag notes with themes such as risk, enablement, innovation, friction, etc.? Link each insight to a potential next step:? Assessment of whether validation is needed? Initiative if the action is clear? Roadmap, if it can be timed and fundedUse Discovery data to:? Update the client’s Business Goal level (maturity + appetite)? Inform CS Health signals (Engagement, Alignment, Adoption)? Trigger governance reviews if the Discovery quality is inconsistent or incompleteThen, include the Discovery summary in:? Upcoming QBRs (4.4)? Roadmaps (3.5) for prioritization? Proposals (3.2) to frame timing and justification? Budgets (3.3) to map expected investmentFinal Output: A Segment-Aware Discovery Process That Powers the CS LifecycleWhen this process is fully implemented, Discovery becomes:? A consistent, strategy-aligned intake that aligns to cadence and role? A signal generator for CS Health, roadmap pacing, and proposal framing? A scalable method to surface change and unlock relevance across the portfolioThis turns Discovery into the most repeatable and robust signal in Customer Success—feeding segmentation, alignment, and initiative planning with clarity and confidence.
Product ConceptSimplify by Client ArchetypesDiscovery Intake is how MSPs learn a client's current level of operation—by asking the right questions, not guessing. It helps define their maturity (readiness to change) and appetite (willingness to act), which together determine the Client Business Goal.The questions you ask—and the language you use—should shift based on this level. Think of it as progressive depth:C - EducateStrategic and structured questions across departments and workflows. Discovery supports deeper strategic planning.A - TransformHigh-impact, high-engagement questions about innovation, OKRs, market positioning, and emerging technologies.D - SustainLow-impact, operational questions. Focus on short-term issues and tactical support.B - ModernizeHigh-impact, strategic questions. The client shows an appetite but may lack full maturity. Discovery helps build a shared language.Discovery doesn’t just gather information—it aligns tone, focus, and expectation to the client’s current state.
How we recommend doing it (product adoption) Create structured conversations that reveal the client’s current goals, pain points, and opportunities, mapped to their Business Goal level. The process consists of four key milestones—each designed to ensure discovery is relevant, actionable, and consistently drives strategic follow-up.Milestone 1: Schedule a Discovery Meeting[7]The first milestone is about laying a strong foundation: you begin by enriching your understanding of the client and their industry. Before any meeting, it’s essential to go beyond basic facts—leverage automated enrichment to gather industry trends, company background, decision-maker profiles, and current initiatives. With this context, you then determine the most relevant CS Strategy quadrant for the client (maturity–appetite), which will shape the style and focus of your discovery. Only then do you finalize the core client information—validating details such as business size, leadership, locations, and technology stack. This preparation ensures that when you schedule the meeting, you can position it as a strategic business conversation, not just a routine check-in.Milestone 2: Prepare & Conduct the Discovery MeetingWith context in hand, the second milestone is all about the quality of the conversation. The tool provides you with a tailored set of high-impact discovery questions, customized to the client’s industry, business profile, and strategic context. During the meeting, your job is to use these questions to guide the discussion across three core dimensions: business goals, enablement/process, and technology posture. The objective is not just to collect surface-level answers, but to go deeper—probing for underlying drivers, change signals, and pain points. It is highly recommended that all insights be captured in a structured, standardized note format. This ensures that no information is lost and all insights can contribute to future planning.Milestone 3: Capture Business GoalsThis milestone is where insight becomes structure. After the conversation, you review the discovery canvas—a visual summary that integrates all client, industry, and meeting data—and use it to extract the main business goals, thematic topics, and initiative opportunities that have emerged. Rather than just saving raw notes, you explicitly categorize each point: what does the client ultimately want to achieve, what business areas or challenges are involved, and what concrete initiatives or follow-ups can move things forward? This transforms unstructured dialogue into actionable CS intelligence that powers roadmap planning, playbook selection, and client segmentation.Milestone 4: Write the Follow-Up and Close the LoopThe final milestone ensures discovery doesn’t end as an isolated event. Here, you organize your notes, validate your takeaways with the client, and send a clear, client-friendly summary of business goals, topics, and next steps. This summary might include a proposed roadmap, initiative recommendations, or the need for a targeted assessment. Crucially, you always schedule the next engagement—whether a project review, roadmap planning, or assessment session—ensuring that every insight leads to concrete action. By following up, you close the loop, demonstrating to the client that discovery leads directly to strategic progress and accountability.LMx Business Discovery Tool Adoption ProcessSmart Goal:"Run your first Business Discovery Meeting, Capture Business Goals, and send a Follow-up to a client."This process is designed to help MSPs confidently adopt the LMx Business Discovery Tool by guiding them through a structured, repeatable engagement. It turns a single conversation into actionable insights, goal alignment, and measurable business impact.Milestone 1: Schedule a Discovery MeetingObjective: Prepare for success by selecting the right client and setting up a meeting with clear intent and context.Steps:1. Add a new client in LMx - Ensure the client profile is created or imported so all discovery data has a structured destination.2. Run and review LMx ClientIQ's Industry/Client Enrichment to gain context about the client’s industry, trends, and enrichment data, allowing you to tailor the conversation.3. Review the recommended business discovery topics - Use LMx’s topic suggestions to frame the conversation around the client’s maturity and industry focus.4. Assemble a compelling email with the scope of business discovery - Briefly explain what Discovery is, what to expect, and why it matters—position the meeting as strategic, not technical.5. Schedule a meeting with the client - Book a time that includes key decision-makers or stakeholders, aligning it with your customer success (CS) cadence (e.g., Quarterly Business Review, onboarding, planning).Milestone 2: Prepare & Do the Discovery MeetingObjective: Conduct a structured, insight-driven conversation that uncovers strategic business context across Business, Enablement, and Technology dimensions.Steps:1. Use LMx’s meeting tool to prepare the agenda - Structure the agenda to reflect the client’s role, segment, and discovery topics.2. Complete their Technology Assessment - Ensure their current stack and operational footprint are well understood before the meeting.3.

How we recommend implementing it (methodology implementation) CS Adoption ProcessProcess Title: Customer Success (CS) Adoption ProcessICP & Scope: 10-employee MSP where one individual (TAM, vCIO, or Ops lead) is responsible for CS efforts alongside other roles. This process is optimized for speed, clarity, and sustainability, without requiring a large team.Smart Goal:“Establish a Process to Capture, Store, and Leverage Critical Business Information from Your Client Base in 30 Days.”Final Outcome After 30 Days? 5 Discovery meetings completed? Discovery insights are documented and categorized? The discovery process is templated and repeatable? Follow-up rhythm established? Strategic inputs feeding into roadmaps and initiatives? First CS rhythm built—without needing a team[8][9][10]?? Milestone 1: First Day – Prerequisites for DiscoveryObjective: Lay the groundwork by preparing your toolset, mindset, and a prioritized client list for CS Discovery.Steps:1. Set the CS Mindset - Commit to running structured, insight-driven Discovery—not just casual check-ins. Define your goal: Understand what your clients value most.2. Pick Your Starter Clients (Top 5) - Choose five active clients with whom you have regular contact. Prioritize those with leadership access or those who have recently changed.3. Configure Your Discovery Toolkit - Choose where you’ll document Discovery: LMx, shared doc, CRM, or spreadsheet. Use templated questions (Business, Enablement, Technology).4. Create Your Discovery Tracker - Set up a simple tracker, such as a table or sheet, to log client name, meeting date, insights, and follow-up status.5. Schedule Your First 3 Discovery Meetings - Book the first meetings using a compelling message:6. “We’re evolving how we support clients and want to check in on what’s changing in your business, so we can better align technology planning.”Milestone 2: First Week – Demonstrate 5 DiscoveriesObjective: Run real Discovery conversations, capture valuable insight, and start mapping the path to strategic alignment.Steps:1. Prepare for Each Discovery Meeting - Review recent projects, support tickets, and past meeting notes to stay informed. Choose 3–5 questions from each Discovery dimension.2. Run 5 Discovery Conversations - Use your structured questions to guide the conversation. Balance curiosity with listening. Don’t try to “solve”—just learn.3. Document Key Insights Immediately -  After each meeting, capture the top 3–5 business priorities or changes. Categorize under Business / Enablement / Tech.4. Summarize and Share Findings Internally - Create a summary or note for each client that can be reused for roadmaps, proposals, and initiatives.5. Send Follow-Ups to Clients - Email a short recap to each client:6. “Thanks for sharing your business priorities—here’s what I heard, and what I’m planning as next steps.”Milestone 3: First Month – Habit CreationObjective: Develop repeatable workflows and integrate Discovery into your regular customer service (CS) routine.Steps:1. Create a Monthly CS Calendar - Allocate time for Discovery sessions, internal review, roadmap updates, and QBR prep. Start with just 2–3 hours per week.2. Template Your Process - Turn your successful Discovery approach into a repeatable checklist:? Pre-meeting prep? Discovery questions? Notes format? Follow-up template3. Integrate insights into roadmaps and proposals - Utilize captured insights to update roadmaps, propose new initiatives, and inform Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs). Discovery is your content engine.4. Review & Refine Weekly? At week’s end, reflect:? What went well?? What could be clearer?? Did clients engage?? Adjust based on feedback.5. Set the Recurring Cadence (Quarterly / Monthly) - Decide the Discovery rhythm by segment. Example:? Top clients: quarterly? Smaller clients: semi-annually? New clients: within 30 days
AppendixHow does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Client Business Goal – Discovery is the primary method for identifying changes in client maturity or appetite, which together define the Client Business Goal level.? 2. Customer Success Health – Strong Discovery directly boosts Engagement and CX. Missed context is a leading cause of failed initiatives and poor Health scores.? 3. Customer Success Delivery – Discovery findings inform every CS deliverable, from the roadmap to the proposal. They define the "why" that gives context to the "what."? 4. Customer Success Process – Discovery is one of the earliest steps in any CS engagement cycle. It feeds initiative intake, strategy development, and proposal timing.? 6. Customer Success People – Discovery empowers CS roles to lead strategic, consultative conversations. It’s a foundational skill for both vCIOs and CSMs.? 7. Customer Success Strategy – Informs engagement depth by segment. High-touch clients benefit from structured discovery. Lower segments may use a simplified format.Product Links / Tooling SupportLabs Client Discovery Tool (Early Access)?

OverviewWhat is the objective?To evaluate a client’s IT environment through a structured, repeatable framework that surfaces risks, identifies gaps, and links technical conditions to business impact. Assessments establish a shared foundation for action planning and progress toward maturity.Why is it important?? Enables standardized benchmarking across clients and time periods.? Surfaces the technical and operational risks that impact business outcomes.? Provides objective data to support roadmap, budget, and initiative planning.? Connects service performance with business potential—moving beyond reactive fixes.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?Without a structured evaluation of the client’s IT environment, you’re flying blind. Assessments transform tactical guesswork into data-backed strategic planning. They surface risks that the client didn’t know existed, and translate tech issues into business priorities—enabling you to align proposals, roadmaps, and budgets with real needs.Assessments help you shift conversations from opinion to evidence, making strategic planning scalable and credible across all segments. They ensure that every recommendation you make is grounded in facts, not assumptions.Assessments are also the critical follow-up to Discovery Intake. If Discovery is about asking open-ended questions and uncovering new business context, Assessment is about narrowing the focus and validating specific technical gaps or risks. This “inverted bow tie” flow—Discovery opens up the problem space, Assessment defines and scopes it—is the foundation of modern Customer Success.Without assessments, initiative planning is vague. With assessments, it's intentional, supported, and measurable.What is the Customer impact?? Clients receive a structured and objective view of their IT maturity—what’s working, what’s risky, and what’s ready for change.? The assessment provides language and clarity, especially for non-technical stakeholders, helping them engage with technology as a business enabler.? It shifts conversations from vague concerns to prioritized plans—clients begin to participate in planning, rather than just reacting to issues.? Co-ownership grows as clients see their risks and opportunities clearly defined.? The impact varies by quadrant:? Low Maturity / Low Appetite (Segment D): Clients see foundational risks and gaps that justify stabilization work.? Low Maturity / High Appetite (Segment C): Clients receive a roadmap they can trust—structured steps toward modernization.? High Maturity / Low Appetite (Segment B): The assessment identifies overlooked misalignments or areas for improvement without overcomplicating things.? High Maturity / High Appetite (Segment A): Assessment feeds into innovation, budget timing, and OKR alignment—providing a validation tool for strategic stakeholders.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: The 3 Duties of an Assessment Every assessment has three key phases:1. Design – Select or customize an assessment template that is aligned with the client’s segment, goals, and risk areas. This defines the scope and framing of the evaluation.2. Do – Facilitate the structured intake session, applying consistent scoring and capturing insights through notes and tags.3. Review – Summarize and present the findings clearly, linking them to initiatives, budgets, and roadmap timing in a way that drives decisions and alignment.Assessment scoring and findings should directly inform CS Health metrics—particularly Alignment, Adoption, and Service Level Fit. A well-structured assessment serves as a foundation for objective scoring and enables measurable follow-through via the Proposal and Budget.Concept #2: Types of AssessmentsDifferent assessment types serve different CS goals:1. Portfolio Scoping – Broad, environment-wide evaluations that identify systemic risks, stack misalignments, or areas for improvement across multiple domains. These assessments typically result in several roadmap items or initiatives and are most often used as a structured follow-up to Discovery. Typical examples include MSP Stack Assessments or generalized Needs Assessments. They help the MSP frame the full maturity posture of the client, detect trends (e.g., outdated assets, missing controls), and structure the next 3–6 months of initiatives. Portfolio Scoping assessments are best suited for mid-to-high maturity clients, and directly feed Engagement and Alignment metrics in CS Health.2. Single Project Scoping – Focused reviews of a specific project, technology, or initiative where the client already has clear intent, but needs expert validation and scope refinement.Office 365 migrations, SharePoint restructures, or vendor transitions are typical examples. The assessment in this case explores feasibility, readiness, and potential blockers related to a single, named project. Although these are narrower in scope, they often uncover hidden dependencies or risks. This type of assessment typically impacts Adoption scoring in CS Health and supports initiative-level ROI validation.3. Risk-Targeted Assessments – These assessments use risk as the organizing lens and are designed to evaluate sensitivity, exposure, and mitigation strategies. Cybersecurity assessments, compliance gap analyses, or business continuity planning fall into this category. Whether portfolio-wide or scoped to a single asset or function, the risk-focused format explicitly evaluates urgency and business impact. These assessments are especially important for regulated clients, sensitive departments (e.g., finance or legal), or any organization with low failure tolerance. Risk-Targeted Assessments contribute directly to the CS Health risk profile and drive prioritization logic in roadmap planning.Each assessment type supports a different moment in the CS lifecycle:? Portfolio Scoping connects Discovery to strategic planning.? Single Project Scoping validates initiative readiness before delivery.? Risk-Targeted Assessments inform governance, compliance posture, and escalation paths.By using the right type of assessment for the right context, MSPs ensure their CS planning remains relevant, efficient, and appropriately scoped to client needs and risk exposure.Concept #3: Discovery vs. Assessment The Inverted Bow Tie - Discovery and Assessment are two parts of one strategic process:? Discovery opens the funnel – It begins with high-level, open-ended questions to understand business context, appetite, and maturity. It uncovers opportunities, friction, and goals.? Assessment narrows the funnel – It closes in on validated findings, assigning objective scores to risks, gaps, and technical readiness. This provides the evidence for action planning.? Together they drive clarity – Discovery is the “why,” Assessment is the “what and when.” One builds context, the other creates structure. The transition between them is intentional and critical.This model ensures CS Health inputs are layered and contextual: Discovery highlights potential areas for growth or concern. At the same time, Assessment defines whether the MSP is ready to act and if the client is ready to commit. Health signals, such as Engagement and Alignment, should be revalidated at the point of Assessment review.Concept #4: Do’s and Don’ts for Effective AssessmentsDo:? Use 5–7 core categories to keep the scope manageable.? Distribute questions evenly across categories to avoid skewed scoring.? Vary answer types to allow both nuance and structure.? Link each section to initiative areas or roadmap themes where appropriate.? Tag each key insight or gap to CS Health dimensions—e.g., low maturity, low Adoption, misaligned service levels—to ensure governance, follow-up, and proposal clarity.Don’t:? Avoid overcomplicating scoring by assigning complex weightings unless necessary.? Use biased or leading questions that suggest a preferred outcome.? Get lost in tech jargon—even technical assessments should be grounded in business language and value.? Ignore the scoring follow-through. If assessment results don’t update CS Health metrics, the data remains passive and unusable.

Implementation ProcessConverting Insight into Initiative Through Structured AssessmentThe Assessment Implementation Process enables MSPs to deliver consistent, segment-calibrated evaluations of client IT maturity and risk posture. Assessments create the critical bridge between Discovery insights and roadmap-driven execution, converting context into scope and scope into action. This process ensures the use of Assessment as a strategic CS tool, not just a technical checklist.Step 1: Prepare Assessment by Segment, Goal Level, and ScopeUse client segmentation and Client Business Goal level to determine:? Assessment scope (broad portfolio, single project, or risk-focused)? Assessment format (in-person, asynchronous, or hybrid)? Timing and frequency (annually, quarterly, or initiative-triggered)SegmentGoal LevelScopeCadenceA5Strategic-readiness, OKRsQuarterlyB3–4Roadmap alignmentQuarterly or Semi-AnnualC2–3Lifecycle & stack reviewSemi-AnnualD1–2Operational baselineAnnual or as neededSelect or design an assessment template that matches the client’s context. Incorporate categories aligned to their risks, goals, or priorities, and calibrate for industry, compliance requirements, or stakeholder audience.Step 2: Facilitate the Assessment and Score ObjectivelyDuring the session:? Apply consistent scoring across 5–7 core categories (e.g., Security, Productivity, Collaboration)? Capture public-facing notes for client use and private internal comments? Tag key gaps or strengths by type (e.g., compliance, user experience, lifecycle risk)Use the Inverted Bow Tie model:? Discovery opens the opportunity space? Assessment narrows it into structured, validated findingsFacilitation style should align with client segment: structured live reviews for strategic accounts, guided self-assessment or asynchronous formats for operational segments.Step 3: Analyze Findings and Convert into Strategic OutputsReview results with a strategic lens:? Prioritize themes by business risk, user friction, and enablement potential? Group findings into initiative categories (e.g., Stack Modernization, BCDR, Automation Readiness)? Identify timeline triggers and required pre-approvals for proposed actionsTranslate each finding into:? A proposed Initiative (tied to 4.5)? A maturity or readiness signal to update the Client Business Goal level? Inputs to inform Proposals, Budgets, and Roadmap milestonesBuild deliverables using structured summaries and visual comparisons to support informed decision-making at the next step.Step 4: Present the Results Strategically and Enable PlanningAssessment outcomes must be delivered as a planning tool, not just a report.? Present improvement trajectories visually (score shifts, trendlines)? Align initiative timing with budgeting and roadmap planning? Use business-language framing when engaging decision-makersDeliver the session in a format appropriate to the segment:? As part of a QBR for Segment B or A clients? As a standalone review or async summary for Segment C or DEnsure next steps are captured: confirmed initiative ownership, timeline approval, or follow-up assessments.Step 5: Reinforce Through Recurrence and Longitudinal TrackingTo reinforce strategic value:? Re-run assessments quarterly or annually based on cadence and client motion? Compare scores over time to track maturity and validate execution? Revisit Discovery themes to confirm alignment or explore new business changesEnsure that Assessment results:? Trigger updates to roadmap items, playbooks, and proposal readiness? Feed into Customer Success Health metrics, especially Alignment and Adoption? Are reviewed in internal CS governance to track consistency and follow-throughFinal Output: A Scalable, Segment-Aware Assessment ProcessAt the end of this process, each client should have:? A completed, tailored assessment aligned to segment and maturity? Risks, gaps, and opportunities scored and categorized? Clear initiative recommendations and timeline triggers? Updated strategic inputs to feed the Proposal, Roadmap, and Budget planningThis turns Assessments into the operational foundation of CS execution, where insights become action, gaps become opportunities, and strategic trust is earned through structure and relevance.
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?Assessments reflect the client’s current level of maturity, in terms of technology readiness, and appetite, in terms of strategic ambition. The assessment’s scope—defined during the Design phase—adapts to this level. At lower levels, the evaluation helps justify tactical decisions. At higher levels, it validates alignment with strategic initiatives and future innovation.This connection follows the Inverted Bow Tie logic: Discovery opens the conversation with broad context, and Assessment narrows it with a scored structure. Each Client Business Goal level defines a different inflection point in this journey.LevelAssessment Intake Focus1.1 Technology SupportLow maturity, low appetite. Design scope: Minimal. Focus on infrastructure basics, such as ticket volumes, patching, backup health, and hardware age. The goal is to validate core service needs.Do phase: Often ad hoc, triggered by outages or escalations.Review: Reinforces operational visibility and builds service credibility.1.2 Technology EnablementLow-medium maturity, low appetite. Design scope: Slightly expanded. Assessments cover stack coverage, core systems health, and alignment with operational needs.Do phase: Establishes baseline standards.Review: Used to recommend replacements, stack changes, or platform consolidations.1.3 Technology ModernizationMedium maturity, rising appetite. Design scope: Broader and more strategic. Assessment includes identifying efficiency gaps, addressing user complaints, evaluating the impact of downtime, and determining upgrade readiness.Do phase: Structured and comparative.Review: Leads to multi-phase roadmap items and budget forecasting.1.4 Business TransformationHigh maturity, medium-high appetite. Design scope: Cross-functional. Includes user experience, collaboration tools, department workflows, and digital friction.Do phase: Requires broader stakeholder involvement.Review: Findings map to business process improvement and initiative timing.1.5 Business InnovationHigh maturity, high appetite. Design scope: Visionary and future-focused. Assessment evaluates readiness for automation, data governance, AI, or OKR-linked initiatives.Do phase: May include benchmarking or industry-specific categories.Review: Supports innovation roadmaps, multi-year budgeting, and C-level strategy.By dynamically adjusting the scope and style of the assessment at each level—guided by the three duties of Design, Do, and Review—MSPs ensure that each client receives an experience tailored to their goals and capacity.How does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Client Business Goal – Assessments provide the technical validation for current maturity levels. As clients evolve, assessments shift from infrastructure checks to strategic readiness indicators.? 2. Customer Success Health – Assessment scores can serve as a proxy for adoption, quality, or alignment, particularly within the Technology Adoption and Service Level Health metrics.? 3. Customer Success Delivery – Assessment results directly inform reports, proposals, budgets, and roadmaps. The structured findings give context to every deliverable.? 4. Customer Success Process – Tightly linked to Discovery Intake and Initiative planning. Assessment output often triggers roadmapping, new project proposals, or escalated engagement.? 6. Customer Success People – Assessments involve multiple roles: techs may gather data, while TAMs, AMs, or vCIOs interpret and present findings. It creates collaboration and clarity across the CS team.? 7. Customer Success Strategy – Assessment templates, risk categories, and initiative mappings are aligned to client segmentation and service catalog standards. Ensures assessments reinforce the strategic CS model.Product Links / Tooling SupportLMx Assessments provide:? Structured, customizable templates to evaluate client IT environments across key risk categories.? Repeatable scoring systems to benchmark and track improvement over time.? Automated creation of Initiatives directly from assessment items—reducing friction in converting findings to action.? Multiple reporting formats are available: Full Assessment, Summary, Comparison, and Item Detail Reports.? Public and private comments for collaborative input.? Risk classifications from “Not Applicable” to “At Risk” for standardized communication.Assessments are fast to complete, appreciated by clients, and seamlessly feed into the CS planning lifecycle—from risk discovery to roadmap execution. This helps MSPs act as proactive, insight-led advisors—not just problem solvers.How do we recommend doing it (product-based) What do we try to accomplish?Establish a structured, scalable process for evaluating a client’s IT maturity and risk posture, designed to translate Discovery insights into data-backed initiatives and roadmap plans.The strategic lifecycle begins with Discovery Intake, where MSPs surface business context, goals, and change drivers. But to move from possibility to action, those insights must be validated and scored—this is where Assessment comes in.The goal of an Assessment is not just to observe—it’s to convert business-aligned findings into prioritized execution. With LMx tools, Assessment output seamlessly powers:? Initiatives: Risks, gaps, or areas for improvement uncovered during the assessment are directly converted into Initiatives, with linked summaries, costs, and recommended timelines.? Technology Roadmaps: These Initiatives are organized into a visual roadmap view, helping MSPs guide execution in a way that aligns with budget cycles, maturity progress, and client appetite.? Proposal and Budget Planning: The structured scoring and categorization allow MSPs to forecast timing, justify urgency, and support proposal approvals with clear rationale.Through LMx’s Discovery Intake ? Assessment ? Initiative ? Roadmap integration, MSPs gain a repeatable, visual, and evidence-driven engagement model. This enables strategic advisory at scale, showing clients not just what they should do, but why, when, and how it drives business outcomes.What is the process to execute?1. Start by selecting or customizing an Assessment Template in LMx. Choose from ScalePad’s template library or create your own from scratch. Use templates to tailor intake around security, compliance, business priorities, or strategic readiness.2. Create a new Assessment Event for the client. Navigate to LMx Assessments > Assessment Events and click “Add New.” Select the template, date, and assessor. Each Assessment Event is company-specific, ensuring contextual accuracy and relevance.3. Perform the assessment using structured scoring. For each item in the assessment:a. Select an appropriate score (e.g., At Risk, Needs Attention, Satisfactory).b. Add public or private comments to explain findings or capture internal notes.c. Use tags to group or filter responses (e.g., “Compliance Risk,” “Revenue Impact”).d. Reference scoring instructions or remediation tips were available to ensure consistency across assessors.4. Create tickets or initiatives directly from assessment items. For any scored item, use the built-in buttons to:a. Open a PSA ticket for service follow-up.b. Create an Initiative linked directly to the roadmap and proposal workflows.5. Download a Summary, Detail, or Comparison Report.a. Choose whether to include public comments, logos, or scoring visuals.b. Use Comparison Reports to track change over time across multiple events (ideal for QBR or Annual Planning reviews).c. Export to Word or store in the report locker.6. Update the Discovery Intake regularly.a. Schedule assessments quarterly or annually, depending on the segment.b. Use automated reminders and dashboard widgets to flag overdue discovery.c. Copy prior events to pre-fill scoring and focus on what has changed.7. Use the Discovery findings to power roadmaps and strategy.a. Assessment scores feed directly into your DMI (Digital Maturity Index).b. Identify trends in client posture and readiness for transformation.c. Align findings with customer experience (CX) and engagement data to target high-impact initiatives.Knowledge Base Resource 1Help Resource 2

OverviewWhat is the objective?To facilitate structured, segment-aligned meetings that drive clarity, alignment, and accountability by turning insights from CS Process activities (like Discovery and Assessment) into actionable outcomes from CS Delivery (such as Initiatives, Budgets, Proposals, and Roadmaps). These meetings are the heartbeat of the Customer Success operating system—translating recommendations into decisions, and decisions into delivery. Why is it important?Meetings are not merely communication checkpoints—they are where decisions are made. They link Discovery findings and Assessment insights to real-world client actions, such as budget approvals, initiative prioritization, or roadmap sequencing.Without a reliable meeting cadence:? Engagement health drops? Proposals go unanswered? Budget planning lacks context? Strategic alignment erodesWith strong meeting rhythms, MSPs accelerate initiative cycles, improve CS Health signals, and create a consistent path to business impact.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Connects multiple CS artifacts (Reports, Budgets, Assessments, Roadmaps) in one conversation? Drives initiative approvals and accelerates proposal cycles? Establishes visibility across client maturity and engagement metrics? Enables alignment with Engagement Strategy and segment-specific playbooks? Reduces the noise of guesswork and reactive tasks by reinforcing strategic focus.What is the Customer impact?Clients feel supported, heard, and led. Well-run meetings provide structure, transparency, and momentum—clarifying priorities, surfacing blockers, and ensuring follow-through. They increase the success of initiatives by turning insights into action and building shared accountability.Most importantly, meetings position the MSP as a strategic leader, not just a service vendor. By guiding the conversation, connecting technology to outcomes, and framing long-term priorities, the MSP earns a seat at the decision-making table.However, when meetings fail to align with the client’s Business Goal level or engagement needs, they signal misalignment, not leadership. The result is disengagement, skipped sessions, and stalled initiatives—especially for high-potential clients who expect proactive, consultative guidance.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Connect ? Clarify ? Commit (the 3 roles of a meeting)Typical MSP cases solved? Great conversations but no owner, no date, no follow-through.? Context is re-explained every time; momentum dies between sessions.How to apply? Connect (2 min): quick recap of last decisions and status.? Clarify (5–10 min): show a 1-screen Business Outcomes Snapshot + Health snapshot (CX, Engagement, Adoption, Service Quality, Alignment).? Commit (rest): request max 2 decisions and capture owner + date; send recap ≤48h.Practical examples? Recap template: What we decided / Why now / Owner & date / Risks / Next cadence.? KPI: ≥70% of strategic meetings end with ≥1 logged decision.Common pitfalls? “We talked” ≠ decisions recorded.? Recap is late or missing, so actions stall.Concept #2: Meetings are the central connector for CS contentMeetings are the moment where every CS deliverable converges. Discovery insights surface the “why,” Assessment scores provide the “what,” and the Meeting is where the “how and when” get confirmed.Meetings are held at:? Roadmaps are validated? Budgets are clarified? Initiatives are approved or escalated? Follow-up is trackedThey’re not just touchpoints—they’re execution checkpoints. When meeting quality improves, so does momentum.More importantly, meetings are the operational mechanism for CS Health validation. If Engagement is low, Alignment is unclear, or Adoption is stagnating, those patterns should be surfaced and discussed here. Governance should monitor whether Health metrics are being reviewed and acted on in meetings.Typical MSP cases solved? Reports, roadmaps, budgets, and assessments all exist—but are never tied together in the room.How to apply? Attach a prep pack to every invite: the 1-page snapshot + links to Roadmap / Budget / Assessment / Initiative tracker.? Review Health deltas in 2 minutes to focus the discussion: what changed since last time?Practical examples? Agenda skeleton: Recap ? Health (2 min) ? Roadmap delta ? 2 decisions ? Next cadence.Common pitfalls? Slide parades with no approvals.? Health signals ignored; early risks stay hidden.Concept #3: Discovery ? Assessment ? Meeting (the “Inverted Bow Tie”)? Discovery opens up the client context—it surfaces opportunities, problems, and direction.? Assessment narrows the focus—it validates risks, priorities, and scope through structured data.? A meeting aligns and activates—it connects insight to execution by facilitating decisions and setting timelines.This flow ensures strategic alignment from exploration to execution.Typical MSP cases solved? Discovery uncovers needs, but there’s no evidence; client hesitates.? Assessment scores exist, but timing and ownership aren’t agreed; roadmap stalls.How to apply? Every ask includes both: the Discovery “why” + Assessment “what/when”.? If either is missing, don’t push for a decision—close the gap first.Practical examples? MFA rollout: Discovery = executive risk/goal; Assessment = current coverage %; Meeting = approval with owner + date.Common pitfalls? Opinion-based asks without proof.? Selling too early; no Discovery first.Concept #4: The “2 decisions + 48-hour recap” minimumTypical MSP cases solved? Eight asks, zero approvals; next steps drift in chat.How to apply? Bring no more than two well-framed decisions: Why this / Why now / Expected impact.? Recap ≤48h; auto-create CTAs with first-action SLA ≤72h.Practical examples? KPIs to track: Recap ≤48h ≥95%; ≥70% of strategic meetings have ≥1 logged decision.Common pitfalls? Decision overload ? decision paralysis.? Recap scattered across email/Teams; no single source of truth.Concept #5: Role choreography in the room (mini-RACI aligned to CS People)Typical MSP cases solved? vCIO does everything; AM/CSM/TAM are passive—or the reverse.How to apply? Default role map? Segments A/B: vCIO = Accountable (strategy & approvals), CSM = Responsible (cadence, follow-through), AM = Consulted (commercial), TAM = Consulted (risk/tech).? Segments C/D: CSM = Accountable, TAM = Responsible, AM = Consulted.? In-meeting choreography:? vCIO/CSM leads;? TAM provides crisp technical facts (three lines, tops);? AM frames budget/timing windows.Practical examples? Opening script: “Two-minute recap. Today we ask for two approvals: X and Y. TAM will cover the technical context; AM will outline the budget frame.”Common pitfalls? Everyone speaks at once; no time left for decisions.? No pre-assigned speaking parts.Concept #6: Decision Log + QBR credit gate (owner + date + budget)Typical MSP cases solved? Roadmaps grow but nothing moves; expansion is claimed without proof.How to apply? Maintain a Decision Log for every strategic meeting (fields: decision, why now, owner, date, budget).? Apply the credit gate: expansion/roadmap credit only when all three are present—owner + date + budget.Practical examples? Portfolio view: Open Decisions by Account; vCIO/CSM review 10 minutes weekly.Common pitfalls? “We’ll get back to you” with no due date.? Budget field omitted ? re-litigation later.Keep the numbers tight (shared guardrails)? Recap ≤48h ≥95%? First-action SLA ≤72h (for meeting-created CTAs)? Exec sponsor seen ≤120 days (A/B ≥90%, C/D ≥75%)? ≥70% of strategic meetings end with ≥1 logged decision? QBR credit gate enforced on every counted decision
Implementation ProcessActivating Strategic CS Through Meeting CadenceThe Meeting Implementation Process enables MSPs to operationalize strategic planning by aligning structured conversations to each client’s maturity, appetite, and segment cadence. Meetings are where CS Process insights become CS Delivery outcomes—ensuring that Discovery and Assessment lead to visible client action, tracked progress, and shared accountability.Step 1: Publish the Meeting Charter + mini-RACI (one-time)What this addsOne page in your playbook that defines: meeting types per segment, the quality guardrails, and who owns what.Default role map? Segments A/B: vCIO = Accountable (strategy/approvals), CSM = Responsible (cadence & follow-through), AM = Consulted (commercials), TAM = Consulted (risk/tech).? Segments C/D: CSM = Accountable, TAM = Responsible, AM = Consulted.Definition of DoneCharter posted in playbooks; every account has a Meeting Owner and a Back-up named.Step 2: Calibrate Meeting Cadence by Segment and Client Business Goal LevelUse segmentation and the Business Goal level to determine meeting rhythm:? Segment A / Goal 5 ? Monthly or bi-monthly strategic meetings with multiple stakeholders? Segment B / Goal 3–4 ? Quarterly QBRs focused on roadmap validation and budget alignment? Segment C / Goal 2–3 ? Semi-annual service and performance check-ins with budget visibility? Segment D / Goal 1–2 ? Ad hoc or annual reviews to maintain alignment and trustMeeting types should evolve with the client’s maturity. Higher-maturity clients require more strategic formats with OKRs, initiative scoring, and outcome tracking. Lower-maturity clients require simpler, cadence-driven meetings that focus on performance visibility.Step 3: Prepare Strategically Using Process Inputs (simple Prep Pack)Before each meeting:? Gather Discovery notes (business priorities, new initiatives, changes in goals)? Review Assessment results (maturity scores, risk categories, roadmap gaps)? Compile CS artifacts (Reports, Budgets, Roadmaps, Proposals, Initiative status)? Evaluate CS Health signals (Engagement, Adoption, Alignment)? Revisit prior meeting notes and open action items to track progressBefore each meeting, the Meeting Owner assembles a Prep Pack:? 1-screen Business Outcomes Snapshot (goals/risks, last decisions)? Health snapshot (CX, Engagement, Adoption/DMI, Service Quality, Alignment)? Links to Roadmap / Budget / Assessment / Initiative tracker? Last recap + open actionsRole split (mini-choreography)? vCIO/CSM leads; TAM gives crisp technical context (3 lines max); AM frames budget/timing windows.Definition of Done / KPIs? % meetings with Prep Pack attached ≥ 95%? Prep review completed by the accountable role (vCIO for A/B; CSM for C/D).Step 4: Facilitate the Meeting to Align and Activate (Connect ? Clarify ? Commit)Run a repeatable, segment-aware structure:1. Connect (2 min): recap last decisions/status.2. Clarify (5–10 min): show the two screenshots (Outcomes + Health).3. Commit (rest): max 2 decisions; capture owner + date; update roadmap.In-room rules? Use shared screen/visuals.? If a decision can’t be made: set a decision checkpoint date and owner.Definition of Done / KPI ≥ 70% of strategic meetings end with ≥1 logged decision.Step 5: Capture, Assign, and Document Outcomes (tight follow-through)After the meeting:? Send recap ≤ 48h using your standard template (What we decided / Why now / Owner & date / Risks / Next cadence)? Update the Decision Log (fields: decision, why now, owner + date + budget)? Auto-create CTAs for each action with first-action SLA ≤ 72h? Tag updated priorities/Health deltas; adjust maturity/appetite if warrantedCredit gateCount expansion/roadmap credit only when owner + date + budget are present.Definition of Done / KPIs? Recap ≤ 48h ≥ 95%? First-action ≤ 72h ≥ 95% (meeting-created CTAs)Step 6: Monitor Progress and Adjust Meeting StrategyMeetings are rhythm anchors; monitor them simply:Weekly 20-min “Meeting Radar” (CS Ops/Lead)? Review Past-due, Next 30 days, and noisy accounts; rebalance by role.? Clear blockers, keep the trigger queue clean.Missed-meeting recovery play? 1 miss ? auto-rebook ≤ 7 days? 2 in a row ? Re-engage CTA (first-action ≤ 72h)? 3 in a row ? segmentation/cadence review in governanceCapacity guardrails (small teams)? Weekly slot limits per role (e.g., vCIO ≤ 8 strategic sessions/week)? Use “batch days”; keep average role load <85%Health checks to watch? Exec sponsor seen ≤ 120 days (A/B ≥ 90%, C/D ≥ 75%)? Engagement trends vs. attendance/decisionsFinal Output: A Consistent, Maturity-Aware Meeting SystemEach client engagement includes:? A segment-matched cadence? A clear preparation & facilitation structure? Actionable outcomes linked to roadmap, initiative, and budget? Strategic documentation and CS Health validationShared KPI set (track monthly)? Coverage (Next 30 days) ≥ 90%? Recap ≤ 48h ≥ 95%? First-action on meeting CTAs ≤ 72h? Exec sponsor “seen” coverage (≤120 days)? ≥70% strategic meetings with ≥1 logged decision? Past-due strategic meetings (downward trend)30–60–90 Day Rollout (small CS team)? Days 1–30: Step 0–1 live (charter, mini-RACI, cadence set). Coverage ≥ 80%.? Days 31–60: Step 2–3 live (Prep Pack + two-decision discipline). Recap ≤48h ≥ 90%.? Days 61–90: Step 4–5 live (credit gate + radar + recovery + capacity). KPIs stable; tune thresholds.
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?Meetings are not a standalone deliverable—they are how all other CS activities are activated. This is why Meetings are governed under the Customer Success Process discipline, not Customer Success Delivery. They serve as the rhythm and review mechanism for everything else: reports, roadmaps, budgets, and initiatives are surfaced, discussed, and approved inside meetings.The meeting type, frequency, and structure should evolve in tandem with the client’s Business Goal level. Each level reflects a different combination of impact (how strategic the conversation is) and engagement (how involved the client is). These variables shape the meeting’s tone, cadence, and content.LevelMeeting Focus1.1 Technology SupportLow impact, low engagement. Meetings are typically ad hoc or reactive—used to review incidents, updates, or requests. The focus is on operational continuity.1.2 Technology EnablementHigh impact, low engagement. Meetings begin to follow a regular cadence (e.g., semi-annual) and may include early roadmap or reporting updates. Clients are still passive; MSP leads most of the conversation.1.3 Technology ModernizationHigh impact, variable engagement. Structured QBRs and initiative tracking become standard. The client engages selectively. Meetings balance service review and strategic planning.1.4 Business TransformationHigh impact, high engagement. Monthly or bi-monthly meetings involve multiple stakeholders across departments. Focus shifts to business processes, enablement, and initiative execution.1.5 Business InnovationHigh impact, high engagement. Executive-level meetings center on OKRs, innovation themes, and long-term co-planning. C-level goals and MSP alignment drive strategic cadence.By aligning meeting format to these variables, MSPs ensure that every meeting is contextually relevant—neither too tactical for a strategic client, nor too complex for an operational one.How does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Client Business Goal – The meeting cadence and format reflect the client’s maturity in terms of technology readiness and appetite for strategic ambition. At higher levels, meetings shift from service reviews to strategic planning. At lower levels, meetings help reinforce service visibility and basic alignment.? 2. Customer Success Health – Regular, well-executed meetings are a direct driver of Engagement Health. Missed, unstructured, or irrelevant meetings lead to low customer experience (CX) scores and stalled initiatives. Tracking follow-through and sentiment inside meetings reinforces Health scoring accuracy.? 3. Customer Success Delivery – Meetings serve as the delivery point for nearly all CS artifacts, including Executive Reports, Budget Forecasts, Roadmaps, and Initiative Reviews, which are brought to life and validated through structured sessions.? 4. Customer Success Process – Because meetings are the central activation point for Discovery, Assessment, and Initiative follow-up, they are governed by the Process discipline, not Delivery. This makes them a coordination mechanism, not just a communication channel.? 6. Customer Success People – Different CS roles are responsible for various meeting types. TAMs and AMs may lead operational reviews; vCIOs handle strategic sessions. The meeting rhythm also enables internal visibility across CS leadership and management.? 7. Customer Success Strategy – Meeting format and cadence are defined at the segment level. Strategic clients receive frequent, collaborative, initiative-driven sessions; others may follow a more standardized or automated schedule. Strategy also governs when meetings shift cadence based on changes in maturity or Health.Product Links / Tooling SupportLMx Meetings provides:?

OverviewWhat is the objective?To define, document, and prioritize client-specific initiatives, projects or significant actions that address identified risks, unlock value, and support progression toward business goals. Initiatives convert assessments, discoveries, or strategic insights into executable action plans.Why is it important?? Links risk and opportunity directly to specific, actionable steps.? Bridges discovery and delivery—reducing miscommunication between CS, sales, and service teams.? Creates shared accountability for execution between the MSP and the client.? Ensures initiatives are prioritized, approved, and aligned with maturity and appetite levels.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Streamlines initiative definition and proposal workflows.? Increases initiative approval rates with precise alignment to assessments and goals.? Connects Customer Success to revenue generation without losing client trust.? Reduces turnaround time for quotes, improving delivery momentum and renewal confidence.What is the Customer impact?? Clients receive tailored, actionable proposals—not generic project lists.? Enables informed decision-making tied to business value, not just technology.? Reduces confusion by aligning scope, budget, and expected outcomes from the outset.? Strengthens confidence in MSP recommendations and advisory role.Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Initiatives Are the Currency of CS DeliveryInitiatives are where strategy meets action. They’re not just “projects”—they’re scoped, named, and time-bound responses to client needs discovered through Discovery, validated in Assessment, and contextualized in Roadmap and Budget. Good initiatives have four properties: they are aligned, approved, timed, and measurable. They give shape to abstract goals and create progress that both the MSP and the client can see.When structured well, initiatives:? Increase proposal approval by showing a clear “why now”? Support phased delivery by attaching to the Roadmap and Budget windows? Allow faster internal coordination through standard formats? They are easier to track, follow up, and close, boosting CS Health and strategic credibilityConcept #2: Segment-Aware Initiative DesignNot all initiatives are created equal. Their size, language, and approval flow must reflect the client’s segment and business goal level:? Segment A (Strategic/Innovative): initiatives align to OKRs, often span departments, and require long-term impact articulation? Segment B–C: initiatives must emphasize business efficiency, with moderate complexity and phased scope? Segment D (Operational): initiatives need to be simple, fix-oriented, and low-friction to approveThis alignment ensures that initiative planning feels relevant, not overwhelming, and that CS cadence matches client readiness.Concept #3: Initiatives Link Discovery to RevenueInitiatives are often the first formal expression of something uncovered in Discovery or scored in an Assessment. That’s why they must retain context:? Why it matters to the client (Discovery)? What triggered the recommendation (Assessment or Health score)? What happens if it's ignored (business risk, missed efficiency, stagnation)When proposals originate from well-structured initiatives, they’re not “sales asks”—they’re mutual commitments to progress. This elevates the MSP from vendor to advisor, improving close rates without pressure.Concept #4: Initiative Health is CS HealthA CS program without visible initiative movement is flatlining. Initiative velocity—how many are approved, stalled, or declined—is a direct indicator of:? Engagement strength (are clients showing up and deciding?)? Adoption maturity (are initiatives scoped to client capacity?)? Strategic alignment (are they linked to Business Goals and Roadmap plans?)If Health scores drop and initiatives aren’t getting traction, it's a signal to reassess the segment, scope, or cadence. Without this visibility, the CS strategy loses accountability and becomes reactive.Concept #5: Every Initiative is a Training ToolWell-built initiatives don’t just deliver outcomes—they train the client and internal teams. They define scope, reinforce communication expectations, and standardize delivery language. Over time, they help mature both the MSP’s internal CS muscle and the client’s trust and confidence.
Implementation ProcessTurning Insight into Execution Through Strategic InitiativesThe Initiative Implementation Process enables MSPs to translate Discovery context and Assessment findings into well-scoped, segment-aware actions that advance the client's business goals. Initiatives serve as the execution backbone of the CS lifecycle—ensuring that insights become commitments, and commitments become progress.Step 1: Define and Scope the InitiativeUse Discovery and Assessment inputs to define what the initiative should achieve, why it matters, and how it supports the Client Business Goal level.? Identify the source trigger: Discovery insight, Assessment gap, Health score flag? Scope initiative size, depth, and framing based on client segment:? Segment A – Strategic alignment, OKRs, transformation milestones? Segment B/C – Efficiency-focused, phased, moderate scope? Segment D – Low-friction, fix-driven, quick to approve? Draft core initiative components:? Title – Descriptive and client-facing? Summary – What this solves, why now? Timing – Ideal quarter or trigger date? Cost/Resource Estimate – Optional in early scoping? Action Items – Linked to roadmap, meeting, or budget timelinesStep 2: Validate and Align InternallyBefore presenting to the client, validate initiative readiness:? Confirm with relevant internal roles (TAM, vCIO, CSM, PM)? Map initiative to the appropriate Roadmap lane (strategic, operational, compliance)? Ensure initiative format matches client profile and segmentation? Flag if client enablement is needed prior to execution (readiness check)Initiatives must support delivery velocity and Health scoring accuracy. For example:? Are Adoption and Engagement levels strong enough to proceed?? Is Service Alignment clear, or will friction emerge?Step 3: Present for Approval in Meeting or ProposalBring the initiative into a structured meeting (4.4) or attach to a proposal or roadmap review:? Contextualize: Remind the client of the Discovery or Assessment input? Frame impact: Use business language, risk avoidance, or efficiency gains? Offer sequencing options: Near-term vs. deferred timing? Confirm owner, approval status, and ideal execution windowTrack reactions as Engagement signals:? Approvals: high trust, aligned appetite? Delays: reassess cadence or budget timing? Rejections: revisit segmentation or readinessStep 4: Activate and Monitor ExecutionOnce approved, the initiative becomes the driver of delivery:? Add to roadmap with defined quarter? Link to project or ticket management workflows? Assign internal and client-facing owners? Track follow-through via QBRs, check-ins, or reporting momentsEach initiative should:? Contribute to roadmap momentum? Reinforce CS Health metrics (Adoption, Alignment, Engagement)? Support multi-role accountability (CSM, vCIO, PM)Step 5: Close the Loop and CalibratePost-execution, assess initiative impact:? Did it address the issue it was scoped for?? Did it reinforce client trust or maturity progression?? Were timelines and cost respected?Use outcomes to:? Refine segmentation or Engagement cadence? Inform future Discovery conversations? Adjust service catalog mapping or playbook complexityTrack initiative velocity and Health signal correlation at the portfolio level to drive continuous improvement across CS strategy.Final Output: A Segment-Aware, Impact-Driven Initiative ProcessEach initiative becomes a visible step in the client's business transformation. When consistently defined, aligned, and tracked, initiatives:? Turn strategy into action? Align CS with value creation? Reinforce segmentation and Health modelsThis process positions the MSP as a proactive success partner, delivering not just outcomes—but structured, trust-building execution.
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?LevelRole of Initiative (Projects)1.1 Technology SupportRare or emergency-based (e.g., backup configuration, patching gap).1.2 Technology EnablementExecution-focused projects aligned with tech stack baselines.1.3 Technology ModernizationInitiatives begin supporting roadmap execution and modernization.1.4 Business TransformationInitiatives support cross-departmental productivity and process change.1.5 Business InnovationStrategic initiatives drive innovation, AI readiness, or client-CS programs.How does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Client Business Goal – Initiatives represent the tactical pathway for progressing toward each goal level. They are scoped based on client maturity, appetite, and desired impact.? 2. Customer Success Health – Engagement, Adoption, and Service Level Alignment scores influence initiative cadence and approval rates. Low scores may trigger additional enablement or scoped downsizing.? 3. Customer Success Delivery – Initiatives feed directly into Proposals, Budgets, and Roadmaps. They form the foundation for strategic deliverables and impact visibility.? 4. Customer Success Process – Initiatives are often the output of Discovery and Assessment Intakes and require a Meeting follow-up for execution. A well-defined initiative ensures follow-through across the CS cycle.? 6. Customer Success People – CSMs, TAMs, vCIOs, and PMs contribute to initiative definition, scope validation, and execution coordination. This fosters shared ownership and alignment across teams.? 7. Customer Success Strategy – Initiative patterns inform service catalog refinement, playbook tuning, and capacity modelling. They help calibrate when a client is ready for more complex or strategic engagements.Product Links / Tooling SupportLMx Proposal (Quoter) supports initiative-driven project workflows with:?

AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?How does it connect to the other parts?Product Links / Tooling Support
1. OverviewWhat is the objective?Turn early interest and discovery signals into qualified, time-boxed Initiatives (with IDs), seeded on the Roadmap and Budget—so Sales hands off a decision-ready context to Onboarding, not just a signed order.Why is it important?Sales is the first CS Health checkpoint and the entry to the closed loop from Discovery ? Assessment ? Roadmap ? Budget ? Proposal ? Delivery. Without a segment-calibrated, decision-first Sales motion, proposals drift, approvals stall, and Engagement/Alignment erode.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Reduce waste: use price testing and pre-approval to avoid scoping work on non-viable ideas.? Improve predictability: seed Roadmap (quarter, lane) and Budget (OpEx/CapEx band) from day zero.? Strengthen trust: anchor every Sales touch with an Executive Snapshot and visible follow-through (recap ≤48h, first-action ≤72h).? Feed CS Health: capture Engagement, Appetite, and Alignment signals early.What is the Customer impact?? Clear why/why now/impact for each recommendation.? Faster decisions through two explicit asks and early cost bands.? Less back-and-forth: stakeholders see the plan on a roadmap and in a budget, not in ad-hoc quotes.2. Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Segment-Driven Sales IntakeSales discovery, artifact depth, and delivery mode match the client’s Segment/Goal Level:? A/B (1.3–1.5): live walkthroughs, strategy language, roadmap seeding.? C (1.2): lightweight discovery, async + 2–3’ summary video, 1–2 near-term initiatives.? D (1.1): minimal intake; stabilize first; no heavy scoping.Concept #2: Price Testing & Pre-Approval (gate before proposals)Never scope first. Validate appetite with a cost band (“Similar clients solved this in $8–12K—viable for Q3?”). Log Owner + Quarter + Budget band as Pre-Approval when the answer is yes.Concept #3: Decision-First Sales = Executive Snapshot + Two AsksEvery Sales touch starts with: Business outcomes & risks, mini-Health (CX/Engagement/Adoption/Quality/Alignment), key trendlines, and two decisions (each with Why this / Why now / Impact / Owner & target date).Concept #4: Three Artifacts, One SpineSales produces a consistent trio that flows into Delivery:1. Discovery Summary (1-pager) ? context.2. Initiative Card(s) (ID, quarter, lane, outcome, dependencies, cost band).3. Executive Decision Sheet (front-matter) for any proposal request. All three must reference Roadmap/Budget positions.Concept #5: Sales as a CS Health Checkpoint (with SLAs)Capture and update Health signals during Sales. Enforce recap ≤48h and first-action ≤72h after every decision moment. Count “expansion credit” only when Owner + Date + Budget are confirmed in writing.
3. Implementation ProcessStep 1: Trigger & Segment Hypothesis? Triggers: inbound lead, cross-sell, renewal window, risk/opportunity from Reports.? Record a segment/goal-level hypothesis (A–D / 1.1–1.5); set expected cadence/delivery mode.Step 2: Discovery (30 minutes, decision-first)? Run the Discovery question set (business drivers, constraints, timing).? Produce a Discovery Summary (1 page) and log mini-Health (coarse CX/Engagement/Adoption/Quality/Alignment).Step 3: Price Test & Appetite Check? Present 1–2 cost bands for the top initiatives.? If viable, capture Pre-Approval (Owner + Quarter + Budget band).? If not, re-sequence on the roadmap and tag the decline reason.Step 4: Seed Roadmap & Budget? Create Initiative Card(s) with ID, lane (Stability/Efficiency/Growth), quarter, outcome, dependencies, cost band.? Add lines to Budget v0 (OpEx/CapEx split).? Gate “credit” on Roadmap placement + Budget band.Step 5: Decision Review (live A/B, async+video C/D)? Open with Executive Snapshot and two asks (e.g., “Approve Assessment,” “Confirm Qx slot”).? Recap ≤48h, open CTAs ≤72h, update Health and artifacts (version note).Step 6: Convert or Park? Convert: If Pre-Approval is captured, move to Upsell/Proposal process (Proposal must start with Executive Decision Sheet).? Park: If deferred, capture decline reason, set an Engagement trigger (date/event), and keep the roadmap/budget in sync.Step 7: Handoff to Onboarding (for new clients) or to Delivery (for expansions)? Handoff packet: Discovery 1-pager, Initiative Cards, Pre-Approval log, Roadmap/Budget snapshot, stakeholder map, cadence invites (book 6–12 months).Operationalization & Governance? Templates: Discovery Summary, Initiative Card, Executive Decision Sheet, Recap/CTA.? Hygiene KPIs (monthly):? Snapshot present in Sales reviews ≥ 95%? Pre-Approval captured on viable items ≥ 60%? Recap ≤48h ≥ 95%; First-action ≤72h ≥ 95%? Proposal linked to Roadmap/Budget = 100%? Decline reason capture ≥ 90%? Days-to-proposal median ≤ 14Common Pitfalls to Avoid? Building full proposals before price-testing and pre-approval.? “Orphan” opportunities with no Roadmap/Budget link.? More than two asks; no Owner/Date/Budget; late recaps.

OverviewWhat is the objective?Convert a signed agreement and Sales context into a documented, access-ready, risk-controlled, cadence-booked account with a baseline CS Health, an activated Roadmap/Budget v1, and launched initial initiatives—so Engagement can run on rails from Day 30 onward.Why is it important?Onboarding is where promises become systems. It creates the system of record (docs, access, assets), stabilizes risk, and establishes the planning rhythm (meetings, roadmap/budget hygiene). Without a clean onboarding, adoption lags, proposals stall, and Health scores degrade.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Reduce delivery friction: complete access + documentation up front.? Accelerate value: deliver early wins and confirm Roadmap/Budget slots.? Make Health measurable: set baseline across CX/Engagement/Adoption/Quality/Alignment.? Enable scale: standard, segment-calibrated playbook that any team can run.What is the Customer impact?? Clear Day-0/7/30/60/90 plan with owners and dates.? Fewer surprises: visible risk register, communication plan, and two immediate wins.? Confidence that IT work maps to business outcomes via Roadmap/Budget snapshots.2. Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Decision-First Onboarding = Kickoff Snapshot + Two AsksOpen the Kickoff with an Executive Snapshot (business outcomes & risks, mini-Health deltas expected, near-term milestones) and two decisions (e.g., approve assessment window; confirm owner for identity clean-up), each with Why this / Why now / Impact / Owner & target date.Concept #2: Segment-Driven Onboarding Depth? Segment A (1.4–1.5): full cross-dept discovery, formal assessments, co-branded plan; live workshops.? Segment B (1.3): structured technical assessment(s), lifecycle & stack modernization plan; live cadence.? Segment C (1.2): lightweight assessment, hygiene initiatives; async + 2–3’ summary video.? Segment D (1.1): minimal intake; stabilize SLA, backup, and access; no heavy scoping.Concept #3: Access & Documentation First, Then OptimizationGate all downstream work on Access Matrix (admin, endpoints, platforms), Documentation Pack (network, identity, vendors), and Security Controls (MFA, backup monitoring). No project kickoffs without these baselines.Concept #4: Onboarding as a CS Health BaselineSet initial Health:? CX: kickoff feedback + early CSAT.? Engagement: attendance, response, cadence acceptance.? Adoption: coverage on M365/backup/AV/patching.? Service Quality: SLA activation, first-call resolution baseline.? Service Level Alignment: scope match vs contract & roadmap.Concept #5: Close the Loop with Roadmap/Budget/ProposalsTranslate discovery and quick wins into Initiative Cards (IDs), place them on the Roadmap (quarter/lane), align Budget v1 (OpEx/CapEx), and only then advance Proposals (with Executive Decision Sheet) if price-test + pre-approval are met.
3. Implementation ProcessStep 0: Handoff (from Sales) – Day 0Artifacts required: Discovery Summary (1-pager), Initiative Cards, Pre-Approval log, Roadmap/Budget snapshot, Stakeholder map, Cadence invites. Owner: AM/CSM. SLA: Kickoff scheduled ≤ 5 business days.Step 1: Kickoff & Executive Snapshot – Week 1? Present Executive Snapshot + two asks.? Confirm communication plan, roles/RACI, escalation paths.? Recap ≤ 48h; open CTAs ≤ 72h (access requests, data pulls). Owners: vCIO (A/B), CSM/TAM (C/D). KPI: Snapshot present ≥ 95%.Step 2: Access & Documentation – Week 1–2? Complete Access Matrix (tenants, RMM/PSA, identity, backup, security portals).? Build Documentation Pack (topology, identity, vendors/contracts, asset lifecycle).? Enable monitoring/backup and verify. KPI: Access completion ≥ 95% by Day 14; Docs baseline by Day 21.Step 3: Discovery & Assessment (segment-calibrated) – Week 2–4? A/B: executive & dept discovery + targeted assessments (security, lifecycle, SaaS).? B: modernization assessments (lifecycle, cloud readiness).? C: lightweight hygiene assessment (backup, identity, patching).? D: skip unless risk dictates (backup/identity mini-check). Output: updated Discovery Summary, scored findings feeding Initiative Cards.Step 4: Stabilize & Early Wins – by Day 30? Execute 2 quick wins (e.g., MFA gaps, backup verification, noisy alert fix).? Publish Early Wins Report in the Executive Report template. KPI: ≥2 early wins complete by Day 30.Step 5: Roadmap & Budget v1 Confirmation – Day 30–45? Place all near-term initiatives on Roadmap (quarter, lane, dependencies).? Update Budget v1 (OpEx/CapEx, bands) and capture pre-approvals (Owner + Quarter + Band).? Two asks: confirm next-quarter initiatives; approve assessment-driven proposal(s) if pre-approved. Hygiene gate: count “expansion credit” only with Owner + Date + Budget in writing.Step 6: Project Launch & Proposal Hygiene – Day 30–60? Convert pre-approved items into Proposals (with Executive Decision Sheet).? Open CTAs ≤ 72h after each decision; assign PM; schedule starts. KPI: Days-to-proposal median ≤ 14 from Roadmap confirmation.Step 7: Health Baseline & Cadence Activation – by Day 45–60? Record CS Health baseline (CX/Engagement/Adoption/Quality/Alignment).? Lock cadence (Quarterly QBR for B/A; Semi-annual for C; Annual for D + triggers).? Create Meeting series and Governance checkpoints (monthly portfolio hygiene).Step 8: 60/90-Day Review & Transition to Engagement? Day 60: review early outcomes; adjust roadmap/budget; capture NPS/CSAT.? Day 90: finalize onboarding closeout note, change log, and handoff to Engagement blueprint. KPIs (portfolio):? Kickoff ≤ 5d ≥ 90%? Access ≥ 95% by Day 14 ≥ 90%? Early wins by Day 30 ≥ 80%? Recap ≤ 48h ≥ 95%; First-action ≤ 72h ≥ 95%? All initiatives on Roadmap/Budget = 100%Common Pitfalls & Fixes? Pitfall: Access delays ? Fix: make Access Matrix a gate; escalate via owner sponsor.? Pitfall: Orphan initiatives ? Fix: Roadmap/Budget link required before proposal.? Pitfall: Too many asks ? Fix: keep two; defer to next cadence.? Pitfall: Stale docs ? Fix: version notes (v1, v2…) with one-line changes.

AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?How does it connect to the other parts?Product Links / Tooling Support
1. OverviewWhat is the objective?Run a predictable, segment-calibrated relationship rhythm that converts onboarding context and strategy into decisions, follow-through, and measurable progress. Engagement keeps the Roadmap/Budget/Health system alive, captures pre-approvals, and prevents drift that creates “At Risk” conditions.Why is it important?Without a disciplined Engagement cadence, reports are ignored, proposals stall, and Health decays. Engagement makes value visible and repeatable: every touchpoint starts with decisions, ties to outcomes, and ends with tracked actions.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Scales: a single rhythm for all segments (A–D) so any CSM/vCIO can run it.? De-risks: early detection of churn signals via CS Health trendlines.? Accelerates revenue: captures price-tests and pre-approvals that feed Upsell.? Improves delivery: clean handoffs to PM/Engineering with clear owners and dates.What is the Customer impact?? Clear, short, decision-first sessions that respect time and context.? Continuous alignment of IT work to business goals and budgets.? Transparent progress and faster approvals (no surprises).
2. Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Decision-First Meetings = Executive Snapshot + Two AsksEvery strategic engagement (QBR/MBR) opens with:? Business outcomes & risks (what changed)? Mini-Health (CX/Engagement/Adoption/Quality/Alignment, ? since last)? Two decisions max with Why this / Why now / Impact / Owner & target date Hygiene: Snapshot present ≥ 95%, ≥1 logged decision in ≥ 70% of strategic meetings.Concept #2: Segment-Driven Engagement Cadence? Segment A (1.4–1.5): Monthly strategic (live), bi-weekly tactical; annual planning.? Segment B (1.3): Quarterly strategic (live) + monthly tactical.? Segment C (1.2): Quarterly or semi-annual strategic (hybrid/async + 2–3? video); monthly service updates optional.? Segment D (1.1): Annual strategic check-in + auto service reporting (email/portal). Cadence is booked at onboarding and owned by the CSM/AM.Concept #3: One Story Spine Across All TouchpointsContext ? Highlights ? Action Drivers ? What’s Next.? Service Reports feed Quality? Executive Reports feed decisions? Consultant Reports/Assessments feed Initiatives Everything rolls up to Roadmap/Budget.Concept #4: Engagement Runs on Health SignalsMeetings are Health checkpoints:? Recap ≤ 48h (decisions, owners, dates, risks)? First action ≤ 72h per decision (CTA open, owner assigned) Portfolio KPIs target: Recap ≥ 95%, First-action ≥ 95%.Concept #5: Gate “Expansion Credit” on Owner + Date + BudgetNo internal “win” without artifacts.? Price-test early (“Clients like you solved this for $8–12k—viable?”).? Record pre-approval (Owner + Quarter + Budget band).? Convert to Proposal only when the hygiene gate is met.
3. Implementation ProcessStep 1: Lock Cadence & Roles (Day 0–30 of Engagement)? Book the year using the segment matrix above.? Assign presenter/recorder: A/B vCIO presents; CSM/TAM records. C/D CSM/TAM leads; AM supports budgets/renewals.? Publish Working Agreement (response times, channels, escalation paths).Step 2: Pre-Read & Agenda Pack (T-5 business days)Owner: Recorder (CSM/TAM). Contents:? Executive Snapshot (auto-pull last Health deltas)? Roadmap Snapshot (next 2 quarters)? Budget Snapshot (OpEx/CapEx, two decision flags)? Service Highlights (tops & tails only; detail in appendix) Timebox meeting to 30–45 min (strategic) or 20–30 min (tactical).Step 3: Run the Meeting (Live for A/B; Hybrid/Async for C; Async for D)? Open with the Snapshot (≤ 5 min).? Decide max two items; capture Owner + Target date + Budget band.? Push detail to appendix/locker; keep the deck thin.Step 4: Recap & First Actions (Post T+48h / T+72h)? Send recap ≤ 48h (template: decisions, owners, dates, risks, version note).? Open CTAs ≤ 72h in PSA/PM; assign owners; link to Initiative IDs.? Update Health with deltas and trigger plays if thresholds fail (e.g., Engagement dip ? Re-engage session).Step 5: Artifacts Stay in Sync? Roadmap: drag/drop changes live, export snapshot to recap.? Budget: version line items (v2, v3) with one-line change notes.? Proposals: create only with gate satisfied; lead with Executive Decision Sheet.? Reports: log to Report Locker; present live for A/B; async (+ video) for C/D.Step 6: Portfolio Governance (Monthly internal)? Review portfolio KPIs: Snapshot present, Recap ≤ 48h, First-action ≤ 72h, % meetings held per plan, decision rate, pre-approval aging, proposal velocity.? Accounts breaching targets trigger a Corrective Play (template refresh + presenter coaching; gate expansion credit until back to green).Step 7: Quarter Close Loop? Ensure each decision resulted in a next artifact (Roadmap/Budget/Proposal/Project).? Capture decline reasons (≥ 90%) to inform At Risk or re-sequencing.Common Pitfalls & Fixes? Overloaded agenda. Fix: Two asks rule; push detail to appendix.? No written owners/dates/budget. Fix: close the meeting only after they are captured.? Meetings without artifacts. Fix: agenda pack is mandatory; recap & CTA SLAs enforced.? Segment mismatch. Fix: use segment templates; don’t “A-level” a D client.4.

AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?How does it connect to the other parts?Product Links / Tooling Support
1. OverviewWhat is the objective?Turn validated needs into right-sized initiatives that advance the client’s roadmap, with clear scope, timing, and investment—resulting in faster approvals and measurable outcomes.Why is it important?Upsell is where value becomes funded. Without a disciplined upsell motion, insights stall, proposals age out, and confidence fades. A signal-driven, decision-first process converts Discovery/Assessment/Health into approved initiatives.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Predictable growth: forecastable expansion tied to Roadmap/Budget.? Lower friction: validate appetite early (price-test ? pre-approval) before scoping.? Portfolio control: proposal velocity and decline reasons feed Health and At Risk plays.? Delivery readiness: proposals hand off cleanly to PM/Engineering.What is the Customer impact?? Clear options, business rationale, and timing—no surprises.? Faster decisions via concise Executive Decision Sheet and known budget bands.? Initiatives that match their maturity and appetite, not one-size-fits-all sales pushes.
2. Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Value-First Expansion, Not Product PushEvery upsell must solve a named business problem (risk, compliance, productivity, growth). Tie to Discovery insight or Assessment finding; speak in outcomes, not line items.Concept #2: Signal-Driven PipelineCreate expansion from signals: Health dips (risk), adoption gaps, lifecycle/EOL, compliance/insurance asks, exec priorities, usage anomalies, roadmap dependencies. Log each signal with source + date.Concept #3: Two-Lane Upsell (OpEx vs. CapEx) Matched to Segment? OpEx lane (licenses, services): lighter scoping; great for D/C.? CapEx/Project lane (platforms, refresh, migrations): phased proposals; fit B/A. Depth and storytelling scale with segment + spend type.Concept #4: Decision Hygiene = Price-Test ? Pre-Approval ? Proposal? Price-test: “Peers solved this for $8–12k—viable this quarter?”? Pre-approval (log Owner + Quarter + Budget band).? Build the proposal only after the gate is met; front it with an Executive Decision Sheet (Problem/Why now, 1–2 options, Impact, Risks/Assumptions, Owner & target date).Concept #5: Roadmap + Budget Are the SpineNo orphans: every upsell item must sit on the Roadmap and in the Budget. Version both as decisions evolve (v1?v2 notes).Concept #6: Proposal Velocity = Health SignalTrack time-to-first-action ≤ 72h, aging buckets (0–14d/15–30d/>30d), win rate by segment, median days-to-approval, decline reason capture ≥ 90%. Stalls trigger Re-engage or At Risk play.Concept #7: Two Decisions MaxIn any strategic session, surface two upsell decisions only. More ? backlog & roadmap.
3. Implementation ProcessStep 1: Capture & Qualify Signals (Continuous)? Sources: Reports, Assessments, Health trends, Lifecycle, Security/Insurance, Exec asks.? CSM/TAM logs the signal with client language; tag lane (OpEx/CapEx), urgency, dependency.Step 2: Price-Test & Appetite Check (T+0–3 days from signal)? Float range (or unit economics for OpEx).? If “yes, if under X and in QY,” record pre-approval (Owner + Quarter + Budget band).? If “not now,” re-sequence on roadmap and note reason.Step 3: Place on Roadmap & Budget (Same day)? Create/adjust Roadmap card (quarter, lane, impact tag).? Add to Budget Forecast with band and decision flag; version note (“added per audit”).Step 4: Build the Proposal (Segment-calibrated)? A/B: deck-style proposal with outcomes/ROI, phased plan, risks/assumptions, OKR tie.? C/D: slim summary embedded in meeting notes + e-sign ready.? Lead with Executive Decision Sheet (max 2 options).Step 5: Present in Context (Next strategic/tactical touchpoint)? Open with Executive Snapshot (Outcomes, mini-Health ?, two asks).? Confirm Owner + target date + budget in writing before “expansion credit.”Step 6: Recap & First Actions (Post ≤ 48h / ≤ 72h)? Recap email ≤ 48h (decisions, owners, dates, risks, versions).? Open CTA ≤ 72h (proposal acceptance, PO, kickoff prep).? Link Proposal ? Initiative ID ? Project in PSA/PM.Step 7: Portfolio Governance (Monthly)? Review KPIs: win rate, median days-to-approval, % proposals with decline reason ≥ 90%, % proposals linked to Roadmap ID = 100%, time-to-first-action ≤ 72h, aging distribution.? Plays: >30d stale ? reset session (offer 2 options: now vs next quarter); >60d ? auto-close or re-sequence with logged reason.Common Pitfalls & Fixes? Scoping before appetite. ? Always price-test first.? Ten options. ? Two options max.? No written owner/date/budget. ? Don’t count credit; hold until artifacts exist.? Orphan proposals. ? Roadmap/Budget link is mandatory.

AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?How does it connect to the other parts?Product Links / Tooling Support
1. OverviewWhat is the objective?Detect, classify, and resolve risk conditions early—stabilizing delivery, restoring trust, and returning the account to a healthy cadence with a clear, measurable Save Plan.Why is it important?Without a disciplined At Risk motion, small issues compound into churn: aging proposals, missed meetings, scope drift, or sentiment dips. A signal-driven, decision-first play prevents surprises and preserves lifetime value.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Predictable retention: Convert leading indicators into fast mitigation.? Portfolio control: Standard scoring and SLAs let leaders prioritize where to intervene.? Learning loop: Root causes feed Process, People, Strategy improvements.? Commercial clarity: When remediation requires spend, it flows through Roadmap, Budget, Proposal—no hidden work.What is the Customer impact?? Faster acknowledgments, clear owners, and visible progress.? A concise Save Plan that distinguishes immediate containment from structural fixes.? Fewer escalations; restored confidence in cadence, quality, and outcomes.
2. Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Risk Is a Signal, Not a SurpriseDefine objective triggers. Examples (any one can flag At Risk):? Engagement: Missed two consecutive strategic meetings; no roadmap movement ≥ 120 days (A/B) or ≥ 180 days (C); champion left.? CX: CSAT < 4.0 for month or 2+ detractor tickets in 30 days; NPS detractor.? Quality: SLA breach trend 2 cycles; backlog aging > 30 days; repeat incidents.? Alignment: Proposal > 30 days stale with no decision; decline reason “relevance/timing” recurring; budget variance > 20%.? Compliance/Security: Insurance/compliance ask unmet; unresolved P1/P2 post-mortem actions. Log trigger + date in Client Health and open the play.Concept #2: Classify Before You Fix (4 Risk Buckets)? Service Risk (tickets/SLA).? Delivery Risk (projects/hand-offs).? Strategic Risk (cadence/roadmap/budget misalignment).? Financial Risk (AR dispute, scope mismatch). Severity = Impact ? Likelihood ? pick containment window and comms level.Concept #3: Two-Horizon Save Plan (Containment ? Correction)? H1 (0–14 days): Stop the bleeding (stabilize service, assign owners, pause scope creep).? H2 (15–60 days): Structural fixes (process, roles, roadmap/budget resets). Each action must show Owner + Date + Budget (or Action).Concept #4: Decision-First EscalationOpen the conversation with an Executive Snapshot: What changed (facts), mini-Health ?, top risks, two decisions max (e.g., “Approve capacity buffer for 60 days” and “Move Endpoint Refresh to Q3”).Concept #5: Segment-Calibrated Response? A/B: Live executive session within 5 business days; monthly progress until green.? C: Hybrid (live + short summary video); simplify asks to 1–2 corrective actions.? D: Async acknowledgment + clear service fixes; avoid heavy strategy until stable.Concept #6: Evidence Over NarrativeTie every claim to Deliverables: ticket analytics, assessment excerpts, roadmap status, budget variance, proposal aging. Store artifacts in Report Locker.Concept #7: Close the Loop in Health & GovernanceRisk open/close affects Engagement, Alignment, Quality, Adoption, CX scores. Quarterly governance reviews trend risks, root causes, and time-to-green.
3. Implementation ProcessStep 1: Detect & Log the Risk (Day 0)? Auto/Manual triggers from Client Health, Reports, PM, AR.? Classify bucket(s) + severity; assign CSM/TAM (owner) and Exec Sponsor.? SLA: Acknowledge to client within 4 business hours (High) / 1 business day (Medium/Low).Step 2: Stabilize (Days 0–3)? Stand up a War Room (internal): Support Lead, PM, CSM/TAM, AM, vCIO/CS Manager.? Containment checklist (selective):? Freeze scope on affected project(s).? Add temporary capacity (after Owner + Date + Budget agreement).? Priority queue for P1/P2; daily brief until stable.? Draft Executive Snapshot (facts only; no blame).? First-action ≤ 72h: open CTAs in PSA (who/what/when).Step 3: Executive Re-Engage & Two Decisions (Days 2–5)? 30–45 min session (A/B live; C live/hybrid; D async + brief call).? Present Executive Snapshot:? What changed vs last meeting; mini-Health with ?.? Root-cause hypothesis (people/process/tech/expectation).? Two decisions (e.g., “Approve 20-hour remediation SOW” and “Reset QBR cadence to monthly for 90 days”).? Gate expansion/credit on written Owner + Date + Budget (or Action).Step 4: Publish the Save Plan (≤ 48h after meeting)? One-pager sections:1. H1 Containment (0–14d).2. H2 Correction (15–60d).3. Risks/Assumptions/Dependencies.4. Version note (v1, v2…).? Distribute recap ≤ 48h; link Roadmap/Budget/Proposals; update Health.Step 5: Execute & Communicate (Weeks 1–8)? Cadence: Weekly progress email; bi-weekly client touch (C/D may be weekly email only).? Keep board current: tickets, milestones, owner status.? If remediation needs spend: raise Proposal (Executive Decision Sheet first) and place it on Roadmap and Budget (no orphans).Step 6: Governance & Escalation Paths? KPIs to track (portfolio & account):? Time-to-acknowledge (target ≤ 4h High).? Time-to-plan (Save Plan published ≤ 5 business days).? Time-to-first-action (≤ 72h).? % actions on time (≥ 90%).? Risk resolution ≤ 30 days (or re-classify with rationale).? Repeat-risk rate within 120 days (aim < 10%).? If no movement 14 days, schedule reset with two new options (now vs next quarter).? If > 60 days open, escalate to leadership; consider contract review.Step 7: Exit to Green + Lessons Learned? Close criteria (pick all that apply):? Health back to baseline or improved for 30 days.? SLA trend normalized 2 cycles.? Approved roadmap/budget reset is in place.? CSAT detractors addressed with follow-up.? Run brief After-Action: root cause taxonomy (People / Process / Tech / Expectation).? Feed improvements to Playbooks, Templates, Role Enablement.Common Pitfalls & Fixes? Hand-wavy updates. ? Publish Save Plan; track CTAs.? Too many “asks.” ? Two decisions max.? Silent proposals. ? Age buckets; >30d triggers reset; log decline reason.? Orphan fixes. ? Everything links to Roadmap/Budget/Proposal/Health.

5. CS PeopleOrganizing the Human Side of Customer SuccessCS People includes five key blueprints:5.1. Roles5.2. Responsibilities5.3. Enablement5.4. Compensation5.5. GovernanceIn Summary
Organizing the Human Side of Customer SuccessThe CS People discipline defines how Customer Success is staffed, enabled, and managed. It determines which roles are involved in delivery, how their responsibilities align with client outcomes, how they’re trained and measured, and how the system stays accountable.Great strategy fails without great execution. And execution only scales when the right people are doing the right things, with clarity, consistency, and support. “Behind every initiative, roadmap, or Health Score is a person. CS People is how we make success human, repeatable, and scalable.”As clients move across the quadrant (from low to high Maturity and Appetite), the roles, responsibilities, and oversight mechanisms must adapt. Tactical support teams evolve into strategic engagement teams. Ownership becomes distributed—but must remain coordinated. CS People ensures this evolution happens by design, not by accident.
CS People includes five key blueprints:5.1. RolesWhat it is: The definition and assignment of Customer Success roles are mapped to client segment, business goal level, and CS Deliverables. Typical roles include TAM, CSM, vCIO, Strategic Advisor, and vCXO.How it evolves: From generalist support roles (e.g. owner/operator) ? to specialized functional roles by client tier ? to multi-role orchestration in high-maturity strategic accounts.Why it matters:? Aligns the right person to the right conversation? Prevents role confusion and fragmented client experience? Supports scalable segmentation-based deliveryHow it connects to the Client Business Goal levels:? Level 1–2: TAMs and service staff focus on stability and lifecycle execution? Level 3: AMs and vCIOs deliver standardization, modernization, and roadmaps? Level 4–5: Strategic Advisors and vCXOs drive transformation and innovation, supporting OKRs, department-level initiatives, and annual planning5.2. ResponsibilitiesWhat it is: The outcomes, metrics, and CS Health are areas for which each role is accountable. Responsibilities are mapped to CS Deliverables (3.x), Process steps (4.x), and strategic goals (1.x).How it evolves: From implicit task lists ? to clearly defined KPIs and deliverable ownership ? to full lifecycle accountability across the CS system.Why it matters:? Links individual actions to client progress? Clarifies ownership in collaborative accounts? Makes Health Score data actionable at the role levelHow it connects to the Client Business Goal levels:? Low levels: Focused on SLA performance, CX, DMI, and reactive cadence? Mid-levels: Initiative pacing, reporting, and roadmap coordination? High levels: OKR alignment, cross-departmental planning, and transformation tracking5.3. EnablementWhat it is: The training, tools, and workflows that prepare each CS role to succeed in their context, including methodology, product fluency, and strategic dialogue.How it evolves: From onboarding checklists ? to role-specific templates and playbooks ? to real-time enablement tied to segment cadence and initiative type.Why it matters:? Prevents underdelivery by inexperienced team members? Drives consistency in how CS is executed across accounts? Ensures roles can act confidently at any Business Goal levelHow it connects to the Client Business Goal levels:? Level 1–2: Enablement focuses on lifecycle talk tracks and service alignment? Level 3: Adds roadmap, budget, and proposal delivery support? Level 4–5: Expands to business conversations, strategic facilitation, and department-specific framing5.4. CompensationWhat it is: The incentive models that reward CS roles for driving the right outcomes—blending retention, engagement, initiative execution, and health performance.How it evolves: From fixed salary ? to retention-linked bonuses ? to multi-factor models aligned with Health metrics and Business Goal progress.Why it matters:? Aligns incentives with strategic CS outcomes? Prevents internal misalignment between delivery and revenue? Rewards deep engagement, not just activity volumeHow it connects to the Client Business Goal levels:? Low levels: Compensation tied to service quality, retention, and ticket velocity? Mid-levels: Bonuses tied to roadmap adoption and engagement improvements? High levels: Recognition for strategic co-planning, OKR execution, and cross-functional initiative success?

OverviewWhat is the objective?To clearly define who does what in Customer Success—making sure every client segment (A–D) gets the right role coverage, at the right depth, without overlap or confusion. Roles set the “who,” responsibilities set the “what,” and together they create the foundation for a scalable, repeatable Customer Success system.We manage CS to NDR/NRR as the north star, using a Growth Loop of Discover ? Align ? Deliver ? Measure.Why is it important?In most MSPs, people wear multiple hats. Owners, TAMs, AMs, or vCIOs often juggle both tactical and strategic work. Without role clarity, this quickly leads to dropped handoffs, stalled initiatives, or wasted senior time on basic tasks. Defining roles and stamping clear responsibilities ensures:? The right person talks to the right client stakeholder (CEO with vCIO, IT lead with TAM).? Every deliverable (Report, Roadmap, Budget, QBR) has one named Accountable owner and a named Backup.? Engagement scales cleanly from reactive Segment D clients up to strategic Segment A partners.? NRR/NDR links CS execution to revenue outcomes (expansion, contraction, churn) independent of new-logo sales.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? It prevents firefighting by making ownership visible in day-to-day delivery.? It avoids “random acts of CS,” where nobody knows who owns the next step.? It enables hiring, onboarding, and promotion to follow a clear path (TAM ? CSM/AM ? Advisor ? vCIO).? It allows a small MSP to act like a bigger one—because even if one person holds multiple titles, the RACI logic stays consistent.What is the Customer impact?Clients experience clarity, not confusion. They know exactly who to go to for technical fixes, service reviews, roadmap discussions, or budget approvals. Trust builds faster because meetings run smoother, decisions stick, and follow-through happens reliably. Multi-threaded relationships also reduce risk: if one MSP contact leaves, another already understands the client and can step in.

+1 Emerging Role: Virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO)? Type: Strategic | Business & Technology-focused? Core Responsibilities:? Leading cybersecurity strategy, risk management, and compliance.? Bridging technical security practices with strategic business outcomes.? Required Skills? Comprehensive background in cybersecurity management, compliance, and risk assessment.? Certification (e.g., CISSP, CISM) and understanding of compliance frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, etc.).? Proven capability in strategic security advisory roles.? Job-To-Be-Done? Internal: Strengthens security posture and compliance, and reduces client exposure to cybersecurity threats.?

Aligns security with business risk and continuity? What makes them less effective? Leads with fear or overly technical language? Focuses only on tools, not business impact? Doesn’t give clear steps or priorities? Works in isolation from the rest of the CS teamConcept #2: Segment-Aware “Responsibility Packs” per Role (A–D)One-size-fits-all role definitions create ambiguity, missed handoffs, and wasted senior time on tactical work. Pack responsibilities by role and segment (4–6 outcome responsibilities per role per segment) so ownership matches client readiness.Segment D (Goal 1 – Technology Support):? TAM/Owner ? SLA rhythm, lifecycle hygiene.? Meeting focus: Service Reviews + Annual IT Strategy Meeting (D).Segment C (Goal 2 – Technology Enablement):? TAM + AM/CSM split: service alignment vs cadence/reporting & initiative intake.? The meeting focus: Service reviews, QBR (C), and annual strategy planning (C).Segment B (Goal 3 – Technology Modernization):? vCIO + CSM ? roadmap, budget framing, initiative pacing.? Meeting focus: QBR (B) and Annual Strategy Planning (B).Segment A (Goals 4–5 – Business Transformation & Innovation):? vCxO/Advisor anchors OKR-linked strategy; CSM runs executive cadence.? Meeting focus: Executive QBR (A) (up to 3/yr if the budget allows it) + Annual Strategy Planning (A).Health focus by segment: D ? Service Quality + baseline Engagement; C ? Adoption + Engagement; B ? Service Level Alignment + Engagement + sustained Adoption; A ? exec-level CX + Alignment + transformation-grade Service Quality.Practical examples? C: TAM owns lifecycle assessment inputs + service alignment; CSM owns QBR (C) delivery and initiative intake.? B: vCIO owns roadmap + budget; CSM runs cadence and progress reporting..Concept #3: One Owner End-to-End (RACI Accountable) + Named BackupWhen “the team” supposedly owns a deliverable, handoffs get fuzzy, follow-ups slip, and meetings drift without decisions. Make ownership explicit by assigning one RACI Accountable per deliverable/process and one named Backup per account. The same person can wear multiple hats in a small MSP, but RACI must remain separate: AM = commercial Accountable, CSM = health/cadence Accountable.How to set it up? One Accountable, consistently: Exactly one named owner per deliverable or meeting type, per account.? Named Backup: Visible on agendas and in your CS tool//PSA/CRM so continuity is automatic (OOO, turnover, load).? RACI stamp on every agenda/template: Accountable | Responsible (prep/follow-up) | Consulted | Informed | Backup.? Follow-up SLAs: Summary within 48h, tasks in system within 72h, approvals chased within 7–10 days.? Cadence & format flex by budget: Keep the Accountable even if you switch from a full QBR to a shorter session or a “deck + 3-minute screen-recorded video + 30-min call.” If budget requires a lighter format (e.g., concise deck + 3-minute screen-recorded video + 30-minute call), Accountable/Backup roles remain unchanged. If budget requires a lighter format (e.g., concise deck + 3-minute screen-recorded video + 30-minute call), Accountable/Backup roles remain unchanged.Meeting ownership (names and cadence aligned to Roles)Annual Strategy Planning (A/B/C)? Accountable: vCIO / Strategic Advisor? Responsible (prep & follow-up): CSM? Consulted: AM (commercial), TAM (technical risks)? Informed: SMEs as needed? Backup: CSM? Output: updated roadmap, OKR links, top 2–3 initiatives with dates/owners.Executive QBR (A) — up to 3/year if budget permits? Accountable: vCIO / vCxO? Responsible: CSM? Consulted: AM, SMEs (security/architecture/etc.)? Informed: TAM? Backup: CSMQBR (B/C) — 1–3/year based on budget? Accountable: CSM;? Consulted: AM;? Informed: vCIO (B), TAM (C);? Backup: vCIO (B) / AM (C).Service Review (C/D) — monthly/quarterly or trigger-based? Accountable: TAM? Consulted: AM/CSM (only if scope/cadence changes)? Informed: vCIO (C)? Backup: AM/CSMCommercial vs. health/cadence (RACI line you’ll keep everywhere)? Renewal & Pricing: Accountable AM, Consulted CSM, Informed vCIO.? Customer Health & Alerts (CX, Engagement, Adoption, Alignment): Accountable CSM, Responsible for inputs TAM, Informed AM, vCIO.Documentation you use? One-page RACI by segment (A–D) per account: list each deliverable with A/R/C/I + Backup.? The RACI field is in every agenda (top-right corner).? The decision log is linked to the roadmap/success plan (who decided, what, when, and next date).Practical examples (ready to copy)? Segment B QBR? RACI: Accountable CSM, Consulted vCIO & AM, Informed TAM, Backup vCIO.? Prep: CSM pulls Health & initiative status; vCIO adds roadmap context; AM tags renewal horizon.? Follow-up: CSM summary in 48h, 2 CTAs in LMx within 72h, next date booked.? Segment A Executive QBR? RACI: Accountable vCIO, Responsible CSM, Consulted AM + SMEs, Informed TAM, Backup CSM.? Output: two exec-level outcomes (e.g., OKR tie-in, cross-dept initiative), next decision date.? Segment C Service Review? RACI: Accountable TAM, Consulted CSM (if cadence/scope change), Informed AM, Backup CSM.? Output: lifecycle gaps + one small approval; CSM nudges adoption owners.Concept #4: Map Responsibilities to the Right Client StakeholdersApprovals stall when you talk to the wrong audience. Keep every conversation relevant—and faster—by pairing MSP roles to the matching client stakeholders and embedding that map into your responsibilities and meeting plans.The simple mapping (use this on your one-pager)? TAM ? IT Lead / Operations — service quality, SLA/lifecycle, adoption nudges.? CSM ? Ops / Admin / Team Leads — cadence, decisions, initiative follow-through, Health.? AM ? Budget Holder / Procurement / Owner-Manager — renewals, pricing, terms, upsell timing.? vCIO / vCxO ? CEO / MD / CFO — strategy, roadmap, OKRs, prioritization, value narrative.? vCISO ? Compliance / Risk / Exec Sponsor — risk posture, controls, audits.? vCTO ? Tech-savvy Exec / Architect — architecture, modernization, innovation.How to operationalize it? Stakeholder map in LMx/CRM (one page): names, roles, influence (D/M/I), preferred channel, cadence, backups.? Invite list by meeting archetype (baked into templates):? Annual Strategy Planning (A/B/C): CEO/CFO + vCIO (A), Ops + CSM included for follow-through.? Executive QBR (A): vCIO + CEO/CFO + CSM; AM only for commercial context.? QBR (B/C): CSM + Ops/Admin; add vCIO (B) for roadmap blocks; TAM (C) for lifecycle items.? Service Review (C/D): TAM + IT/Ops; CSM attends only if cadence/scope changes.? Pre-flight check (48–72h prior): confirm the decision-maker is present; otherwise rescope (shorter session + book a decision call with the right exec).? Aftercare: Decisions are logged to the success plan/roadmap, tasks are assigned to the people who are in the room, and renewal timing is noted for AM.Segment-aware meeting aim (who must be in the room)? A (4–5): Executive relevance is non-negotiable ? CEO/CFO + vCIO/vCxO in Executive QBRs; CSM ensures outcomes and next steps are locked.? B (3): Move decisions faster ? Ops + CSM for QBR; vCIO joins roadmap segments; invite budget holder when approvals are expected.? C (2): Keep it operational ? IT/Ops + TAM for Service Reviews; CSM handles cadence and captures initiative intake.? D (1): Keep it simple ? Owner/Manager + TAM annually; otherwise Service Reviews with IT/Ops.Templates that make this stick? Agenda header: “Stakeholders for this session (Name, Role, Why here, Decision right)”.? Slide 1: “What we need from you today” (approve X, choose Y, confirm date Z).? Email pre-read: 3 bullets (last outcomes, today’s decisions, what happens next).Practical examples (ready to copy)? B-segment Roadmap + Budget Checkpoint? Attendees: vCIO + CSM + Ops Lead + Budget Holder (Owner/CFO).? Flow: CSM (cadence & status) ? vCIO (sequence & value) ? Budget holder (approve 1–2 items).? Output: approvals captured; next decision date; renewal note to AM.? C-segment Quarterly Review (QBR)? Attendees: CSM + Ops/Admin, TAM for lifecycle portion.? Flow: CSM (Engagement & initiative status) ? TAM (adoption/lifecycle gaps) ? CSM (one small approval).? Output: one approved initiative; tasks in LMx; 90-day date booked.? A-segment Executive QBR? Attendees: vCIO / vCxO + CEO/CFO + CSM; AM consulted if commercial topics arise.? Flow: vCIO (value recap vs. OKRs) ? decisions (2 max) ? CSM (next steps, owners, dates).? Output: exec-level outcomes; risks noted for vCISO/vCTO if relevant; follow-through meetings set.? D-segment Annual IT Strategy? Attendees: Owner/Manager + TAM.? Flow: TAM (SLA/asset hygiene, 12-month priorities) ? pick one improvement ? agree on a simple date/budget.? Output: A single upgrade is scheduled; Service Reviews will handle the rest.Concept #5: Responsibility = Process Ownership (Trigger ? Prep ? Lead ? Follow-Up)Fragmented task lists create invisible gaps. Make ownership visible and end-to-end for every CS motion using a simple arc: Trigger ? Prep ? Lead ? Follow-Up, with a single RACI Accountable and a named Backup per account. Stamp this at the top of every agenda/template so no one has to guess.Apply by meeting type (aligned to Roles & cadence):Annual Strategy Planning (A/B/C)? Accountable: vCIO / Strategic Advisor? Responsible (prep & follow-up): CSM? Consulted: AM (commercial context), TAM (technical risks)? Backup: CSM? Outputs: Updated roadmap, OKRs link, and next 2–3 initiatives with dates.Executive QBR (A) — up to 3/year if budget permits? Accountable: vCIO / vCxO? Responsible (prep & follow-up): CSM? Consulted: AM, SMEs (as needed)? Backup: CSM? Outputs: exec-level progress, decisions, approvals, and a refreshed success plan.QBR (B/C) — 1–3/year based on budget? Accountable: CSM? Consulted: AM, vCIO (B), TAM? Informed: SMEs as needed.Service Review (C/D) — monthly/quarterly or trigger-based? Accountable: TAM? Consulted: AM/CSM (only if scope/cadence changes)? Backup: AM/CSM? Outputs: SLA & lifecycle hygiene, risks, ticket trends, adoption nudges.Make it operational with lightweight guardrails:? Agenda header “RACI stamp” (Accountable | Backup | Consulted | Informed).? Follow-up SLA: summary in 48h, tasks in CS tool//PSA in 72h, approvals chased within 7–10 days.? Templates: every deck/report starts with “Owner (A), Backup, Next review date”.? Handoff notes: a one-page “decision log” linked to the roadmap/success plan.Practical examples (ready to copy):? Segment B QBR (CSM Accountable)? Trigger: QBR due in 30 days (auto-notice).? Prep: CSM pulls Health & initiative status; vCIO adds roadmap notes.? Lead: CSM runs the meeting; vCIO handles roadmap questions.? Follow-Up: CSM sends 48h summary, creates 2 CTAs, books next date.? Segment C Service Review (TAM Accountable)? Trigger: monthly SLA review.? Prep: TAM updates lifecycle gaps; CSM adds any engagement risks.? Lead: TAM walks tickets/SLA/adoption; asks for one small approval.? Follow-Up: TAM logs decisions; CSM nudges adoption task owners.Concept #6: Use Health to Tune Responsibilities (Measure ? Signal ? Adjust)When Health dips, don’t swap tools—retune RACI ownership. Treat CX, Engagement, Adoption, and Service Level Alignment as routing signals that decide who leads what for the next cycle.Portfolio Health is summarized on CX, Engagement, Adoption, and Alignment. Service Quality is a TAM-owned input that feeds Adoption/Alignment and is reviewed in Service Reviews.Simple playbook:? Measure weekly (portfolio board) and before each meeting.? Signal thresholds (example):? Engagement < target for two cycles ? CSM escalates cadence reset.? Adoption ? 10–20% in C ? TAM deep-dives assessments; CSM owns follow-up.? CX risk in A ? vCIO/vCxO must own the next Executive QBR agenda.? Adjust ownership for one quarter, then revert or lock in.By segment—typical retunes:? A (4–5): Low CX or unclear exec value ? vCxO/vCIO leads next Executive QBR; CSM tightens pre-work & decision capture; AM consulted on commercial impacts only.? B (3): Slipping decision velocity ? CSM remains Accountable for cadence, vCIO co-leads roadmap block until two approvals land.? C (2): Adoption stalls ? CSM becomes Accountable for initiative follow-through for 60 days; TAM focuses on lifecycle inputs and risk notes.? D (1): SLA noise ? TAM is kept accountable; CSM joins only if scope/cadence needs to change.Lightweight governance:? Health + Role board (columns: Segment, Health signal, Who is Accountable now, When we revert).? Green target: 80% of accounts “on target” mid-year; review exceptions monthly.Practical examples (ready to copy):? A account, CX amber ? Next Executive QBR: Accountable vCIO, Responsible CSM; add “Value recap” slide, confirm two executive-level outcomes; CSM books a 30-min follow-through within 7 days.? C account, Adoption down 15% ? CSM Accountable for two initiatives; TAM updates DMI and provides config notes; weekly 15-min sync until back to baseline.? Any segment missed approvals twice ? CSM is accountable for resetting cadence (shorter QBR, clear CTAs); AM is consulted if renewal timing collides.? NRR/NDR ownership (KPI): AM = Accountable; CSM = Consulted (engagement/health signals); TAM = Responsible (inputs); vCIO = Consulted (A/B roadmap decisions).Concept #7: Same Logic as You Grow (Small ? Mid ? Large MSP)Growth and budget shifts shouldn’t force a redesign. Keep the same responsibility logic and split it cleanly as your portfolio and CS budget evolve—precisely as defined in 5.1 Roles.Calibration rules (match Roles 1:1):? AM vs CSM stays separated in RACI even if one person covers both day-to-day.? Commercial (renewals, pricing, proposals) = AM Accountable? Health & Cadence (CX, Engagement, Adoption, Alignment) = CSM AccountableMeeting mix by segment & budget? A: 1? Annual Strategy Planning + up to 3 Executive QBRs (budget-dependent).? B/C: 1? Annual Strategy Planning + 1–3 QBRs (budget-dependent).? D: 1? Annual IT Strategy Meeting + Service Reviews.? Specialists (vCISO, vCTO) join Segment A when justified by risk/innovation—not by habit.? If budget tightens: keep Accountables, downgrade format (e.g., QBR ? concise deck + 3-min screen-recorded video + 30-min call), but do not drop the owner.Quarterly RACI refresh (fast checklist):? Per segment, verify each deliverable’s Accountable + Backup.? Remove senior roles from C/D unless needed; add vCIO/vCxO to A if CX/Alignment lags.? Confirm AM=commercial and CSM=health/cadence in all agendas and templates.? Tie any changes to Enablement updates (talk tracks, checklists) and Compensation levers.Practical examples (ready to copy):? Budget cut in a B account ? Keep CSM Accountable for QBR; switch to shorter QBR cadence with one approval per cycle; vCIO consulted only for roadmap decisions.? C account grows into B ? Add Annual Strategy Planning (Accountable vCIO), keep CSM Accountable for QBRs; introduce one roadmap initiative per quarter.? A account adds security scope ? Invite vCISO as consulted to Executive QBR; vCIO remains Accountable; CSM owns follow-up and risk register updates.
Implementation ProcessDefining Roles for Scalable, Segment-Aware Engagement The Roles Implementation Process ensures that MSPs define, assign, and operationalize Customer Success roles based on client maturity, appetite, and Business Goal level. This process creates the foundation for delivering consistent value, enabling strategic alignment, and tracking impact through role clarity and accountability.Operationalizing Responsibilities for Scalable, Segment-Aligned CS Execution Goal: turn role definitions into clear, segment-aware ownership with smooth handoffs, the right people in the room, and Health-driven adjustments.Step 1: Design Roles Based on Client Segments and Business GoalsStart by mapping roles to each client segment, using segmentation and Client Business Goal levels to calibrate role depth and complexity:SegmentGoal LevelPrimary Roles InvolvedPurposeA4–5vCxO, Strategic Advisor, SMEs (e.g., vCISO for risk/compliance; vCTO for architecture/innovation)Drive innovation, OKRs, and cross-departmental planningB3vCIO, CSMEnable business alignment and initiative executionC2TAM, AM/CSMEnsure operational quality, stack alignment, and roadmap deliveryD1TAM, Owner/FounderMaintain service visibility, reinforce stabilityRole depth should scale by both strategic ambition and delivery needs—not simply by contract size. Smaller MSPs may assign multiple roles to a single person, but role functions must remain distinct and visible.Step 2: Build the one-page Responsibility Matrix (by segment A–D)Create a single page per segment that lists every recurring CS deliverable and its RACI per account, plus a named Backup.Deliverables to include? Annual Strategy Planning (A/B/C)? Executive QBR (A)? QBR (B/C)? Service Review (C/D)? Assessments / DMI inputs? Reports (creation & delivery)? Initiatives & Budget drafting? Health Dashboard & Alerts? Renewal & PricingRACI quick rules? Exactly one Accountable per item.? Always list a Backup (person, not “the team”).? Keep AM vs. CSM split even if one person holds both titles:? Commercial = AM (Accountable)? Health/Cadence = CSM (Accountable)Starter example (copy into your template)? Annual Strategy Planning (A/B/C) ? A: vCIO | R: CSM | C: AM | I: TAM | Backup: CSM? Executive QBR (A) ? A: vCIO | R: CSM | C: AM, SMEs | I: TAM | Backup: CSM? QBR (B/C) ? A: CSM | C: AM; vCIO (B), TAM (C) | I: SMEs | Backup: vCIO (B) / AM (C)? Service Review (C/D) ? A: TAM | C: AM/CSM (if scope/cadence changes) | I: vCIO (C) | Backup: CSM? Renewal & Pricing ? A: AM | C: CSM | I: vCIO | Backup: AM delegate? Health Dashboard & Alerts ? A: CSM | R (inputs): TAM | I: AM, vCIO | Backup: AMStep 3: Assign Role Ownership for Key CS DeliverablesAlways name an Accountable role and a Backup for every deliverable. Clarify which roles are RACI owners (Accountable = single named owner) for each deliverable, and add a named Backup per account for continuity.? TAM/SDM ? Service Reviews (Lead), Health inputs, basic assessments (A/R).? AM/CSM ? QBR (Lead in B/C), Engagement tracking, initiative intake (A).? vCIO/Strategic Advisor ? Executive QBRs (Lead in A) and annual Strategy Planning (Lead A/B/C), budget framing (A).? Specialists/SMEs (vCISO, vCTO) ? consulted primarily in A (and sometimes B) accounts when risk/innovation justifies.Map each RACI owner to the matching client stakeholder (e.g., vCIO ? CEO/CFO; AM/CSM ? Ops/Admin; TAM ? IT lead). Create a role-to-segment engagement matrix. This becomes the foundation for planning team coverage, onboarding paths, and accountability during cadence-based execution. The deliverable owner should also be the relationship owner for the corresponding client stakeholder.For every deliverable and meeting, assign a RACI owner (Accountable) and a named Backup per account to guarantee continuity (no ‘the team’ owners).? Annual Strategy Planning (A/B/C) — Accountable: vCIO; Responsible: CSM (prep & follow-up); Consulted: AM; Informed: TAM.? Executive QBR (A) — Accountable: vCIO; Responsible: CSM; Consulted: AM; Informed: TAM/SMEs.? QBR (B/C) — Accountable: CSM; Consulted: AM; Informed: vCIO (B), TAM (C).? Service Review (C/D) — Accountable: TAM; Consulted: AM/CSM (if scope/cadence changes); Informed: vCIO (C).? Renewal & Pricing — Accountable: AM; Consulted: CSM; Informed: vCIO.? Health Dashboard & Alerts (CX/Engagement/Adoption/Alignment) — Accountable: CSM; Responsible (inputs): TAM; Informed: AM, vCIO.The deliverable owner is also the relationship owner for the matching client stakeholder.Step 4: Stamp RACI into every meeting and deliverable templateAdd a tiny RACI block to the top-right of agendas, notes, and report covers so ownership is visible in every interaction.Agenda header (paste this)? Accountable | Responsible | Consulted | Informed | Backup? Decisions needed today (max 2): …? Who decides: Name/Role? Follow-up SLA: Summary in 48h; CTAs in system in 72h; approvals chased within 7–10 daysDocumentation habit? Log decisions to the Success Plan/Roadmap (not just email).? Assign named owners + dates for each CTA in your CS tool//PSA/CRM.? Book the next date before the call ends.? If budget requires a lighter format (e.g., concise deck + 3-minute screen-recorded video + 30-minute call), Accountable/Backup roles remain unchanged.Step 5: Operationalize Roles Through Playbooks and Process AlignmentFor every meeting type, set Trigger ? Prep ? Lead ? Follow-up with a RACI owner and Backup:? Strategy Planning (annual, A/B/C): Lead = vCIO/Strategic Advisor; Backup = CSM.? Executive QBR (A): Lead = vCIO/Strategic Advisor; Backup = CSM. Target 3/yr if budget permits.? QBR (B/C): Lead/Accountable = CSM; Consulted = AM; Informed = vCIO (B), TAM (C); Backup = vCIO (B) / AM (C). 1–3/yr depending on budget.? Service Review (C/D): Lead = TAM; Backup = AM/CSM. Monthly/quarterly or trigger-based.Ensure each role is embedded in process flows.? Assign meeting ownership by segment and type (e.g., vCIO ? Strategy Meeting; TAM ? Service Review)? Define initiative lead role per segment (e.g., CSM for C-level clients; TAM for D-level)? Link roles to reporting: who presents which reports, and to whom?? Align intake responsibilities: Discovery and Assessment prep should have named role owners.This alignment reduces confusion, increases consistency, and ensures roles are actioned—not just labelled.Bake responsibilities into simple, repeatable playbooks Turn each deliverable into a 4-step mini-playbook with explicit ownership.Trigger ? Prep ? Lead ? Follow-up (examples)? QBR (B/C)? Trigger: CSM (Health window/cadence)? Prep: CSM (status & slides), vCIO (B roadmap), TAM (C lifecycle)? Lead: CSM (Accountable)? Follow-up: CSM (summary/CTAs), AM (commercial notes)? Executive QBR (A)? Trigger: CSM (exec cadence)? Prep: CSM (storyline & outcomes), vCIO (value/OKR link), AM (commercial horizon)? Lead: vCIO (Accountable)? Follow-up: CSM (actions/dates), AM (renewal timing), vCIO (risks to next Strategy checkpoint)? Service Review (C/D)? Trigger: TAM (SLA/lifecycle)? Prep: TAM (tickets, adoption, asset gaps)? Lead: TAM (Accountable)? Follow-up: TAM (technical CTAs), CSM (if cadence/scope changes)? Renewal & Pricing? Lead/Accountable: AM; Consulted: CSM; Informed: vCIOPut these 4-step strips on the agenda footer so no one wonders who does what next.Step 6: Tie responsibilities to the right stakeholders and cadenceUse the role-to-stakeholder map and the segment cadence rules from Roles.Who talks to whom? TAM ? IT/Ops (service, lifecycle, adoption nudges)? CSM ? Ops/Admin/Team Leads (cadence, decisions, follow-through, Health)? AM ? Owner/Procurement/Budget holder (renewal, pricing, terms)? vCIO/vCxO ? CEO/CFO (strategy, OKRs, prioritization)? vCISO ? Compliance/Risk | vCTO ? Tech-savvy exec/architectCadence by segment (name meetings correctly)? A (4–5): Annual Strategy Planning + Executive QBR (up to 3/year if budget permits)? B/C (3 / 2): Annual Strategy Planning + QBR (1–3/year based on budget)? D (1): Annual IT Strategy only; use Service Reviews for operational rhythmPre-flight check (48–72h before)? Confirm decision-maker attendance; if missing, switch to a shorter update and book a decision call with the right exec.? Keep the invite list lean and role-matched.Step 7: Use CS Health as a Feedback Loop to Optimize Role CoverageTrack Engagement, CX, and Alignment scores to detect whether roles are misaligned with client expectations. Examples:? Low CX in Segment A ? Possibly lacking strategic facilitation (assign or improve vCxO coverage)? Low Adoption in Segment C ? Potential misfit between TAM and roadmap follow-through? Missed Initiatives or Roadmaps ? Likely absence of CSM ownership or cadence planningCreate internal Health + Role dashboards to monitor which roles produce results and where refinement or support is needed.Treat Health as routing signals for responsibility fixes, not just reports.Fast adjustments? Low Engagement (any segment): CSM runs re-engagement play (short update + decision call) and keeps Accountable until green.? Low Adoption (C): Keep TAM responsible for assessment inputs, and make CSM accountable for follow-through (weekly nudges for 60 days).? Low CX (A): Add/strengthen vCIO/vCxO presence in the next Executive QBR; CSM keeps actions tight.? Missed initiatives (any): Reset cadence; CSM Accountable for follow-up SLA; escalate to vCIO if decisions slip >30 days.Simple dashboard? One sheet per segment: Owner | Backup | Last meeting | Next date | Health (CX/Eng/Adopt/Align) | Risks | Next action.? Review weekly inside the CS team; escalate exceptions in your internal governance huddle.Step 8: Review Roles Quarterly and Scale with Client & Team MaturityAs clients mature, their role expectations shift. Conduct quarterly role reviews across the CS portfolio:? Promote TAM ? AM/CSM ? Strategic Advisor as engagement complexity rises? Reassign clients based on role bandwidth, Health data, or Business Goal level changes? Use playbook coverage and deliverable execution to identify team gaps? Tie role progression to enablement and compensation plans (see 5.3 and 5.4)? Establish recurring CS leadership checkpoints to review each role category's segment-role alignment, escalation patterns, and staffing capacity.Every quarter, run a short Responsibilities Review to keep the system sharp:Checklist? Is Accountable still the proper role by segment? (Avoid senior over-servicing C/D)? Are Backups named and present in key calls?? Are AM (commercial) and CSM (health/cadence) still clearly split in RACI?? Are Strategy/QBR/Service Review counts aligned to budget and segment rules?? Do we need to introduce vCISO/vCTO in A accounts?? Any role progression we can unlock (TAM ? CSM ? Advisor)?Update the one-page matrices, agendas, and playbooks and keep going.Final Output: A Role-Aligned Customer Success SystemWhen implemented correctly, the MSP will have:? Clear role definitions calibrated to client segments and goal levels? Assigned ownership of all strategic and operational CS deliverables? Embedded roles across the CS lifecycle (Discovery, Roadmap, Meeting, Budget)? Measurable accountability tied to Customer Success Health? A scalable role system that evolves with both the team and the client base“Done” looks like this? Every deliverable has one Accountable, a named Backup, and a visible RACI on the agenda.? Meeting names and cadences match the segment rules (Strategy Planning / Executive QBR / QBR / Service Review).? Stakeholder mapping ensures the right people are in the room, every time.? Follow-ups hit the 48h/72h/7–10d rhythm and live in the Success Plan/Roadmap.? Health triggers change responsibilities or add coverage—you can see that on a single sheet.

Client Business Goal – Role specialization evolves with client maturity and appetite. Higher levels require strategic, consultative roles, while foundational levels may only require reactive technical support.2. Customer Success Health – CX, Engagement, and Service Level metrics inform whether current roles are sufficient or need adjustment. Role depth influences perception, participation, and satisfaction.3. Customer Success Delivery – Certain deliverables (e.g., Strategy, Roadmap) require specific roles, such as vCIO or Strategic Advisor, to be effective. Role ownership helps ensure deliverables are understood and actionable.4. Customer Success Process – Roles must be aligned with intake, meeting, and initiative workflows. Poor alignment can lead to dropped handoffs or unclear ownership of customer service activities.5. Customer Success Strategy – Segmentation and SOPs dictate role engagement by client tier. Strategy must account for role bandwidth, specialization, and scalability across segments.6. North-star KPI – We track NRR/NDR for existing clients; AM Accountable, CSM Consulted (health), TAM Responsible (inputs), vCIO Consulted (A/B roadmap).Responsibilities View1. Client Business Goal – Responsibilities evolve as the client moves up in maturity and appetite. Tactical roles dominate early stages, while strategic, planning, and innovation responsibilities emerge at higher levels.2. Customer Success Health – Role responsibilities directly impact CS Health metrics: Account Managers (AMs) and Customer Success Managers (CSMs) influence Engagement and Customer Experience (CX); vCIOs drive Technology Adoption and Service Level Alignment; Technical Account Managers (TAMs) and Technical Specialists (Techs) affect Service Quality.3. Customer Success Delivery – Each deliverable (e.g., Budgets, Roadmaps, Proposals) requires clear ownership to ensure they are appropriately produced, presented, and followed up on.4. Customer Success Process – Responsibilities dictate who triggers, prepares, leads, and follows up in each SOP/playbook and ensure cadence adherence (Strategy Planning, Executive QBR/QBR, Service Review).5. Customer Success People – Responsibilities reflect the finalized Roles model and RACI usage. Keep AM and CSM distinct in RACI even if one person holds both titles (commercial = AM Accountable; health/cadence = CSM Accountable).6. Customer Success Strategy – Segmentation, SOPs, and capacity models require role-specific responsibilities to be well-defined. This allows the CS strategy to scale across segments without confusion or duplication.7. Metrics Link – NRR (a.k.a. NDR) is the primary outcome KPI; GRR, Expansion %, and Churn % are supporting metrics.Product Links / Tooling SupportNot currently tied to a specific LMx product feature. Role modelling is part of MSP organizational design and delivery planning. Future tooling may support role-to-client alignment, role competency mapping, and visibility at the engagement level.

OverviewWhat is the objective?Equip each CS role (TAM, AM, CSM, vCIO, and—when justified—vCTO/vCISO) with simple, “in-the-flow” tools and micro-skills to deliver their segment-calibrated responsibilities (A=4–5, B=3, C=2, D=1). Enablement activates Roles & Responsibilities with lightweight playbooks, talk tracks, templates, checklists, and live reports/alerts, all tied to clear RACI ownership (one Accountable + a named Backup) and the standard meeting types and cadence:? Annual Strategy Planning (A/B/C)? Executive QBR (A, up to 3/year if budget permits)? QBR (B/C, 1–3/year based on budget)? Service Review (C/D)Enablement ladders explicitly to the NRR/NDR north star and follows the Growth Loop of Discover ? Align ? Deliver ? Measure.Why is it important?? Turns role definitions into execution: people know what to run, with which asset, for which segment, and who is Accountable.? Reduces Health drift: health signals (CX, Engagement, Adoption/DMI, Service Quality, Alignment) trigger concise plays with owners and due dates.? Fits MSP reality: keeps QBR/Service Review central, avoids enterprise process bloat, and protects senior capacity for A/B.? Strengthens multi-threading: each deliverable has one Accountable, a Backup, and the right client counterpart.? Speeds ramp: short, role-based guides and check-rides standardize outcomes without heavy training programs.? Creates a straight line of sight from enablement usage to revenue outcomes (NRR/NDR).As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Stamp RACI (Accountable/Responsible/Consulted/Informed + Backup) on every agenda, template, and report—no “the team” owners.? Ship role?segment packs that mirror Responsibilities:? A: vCIO strategy/OKR facilitation; CSM follow-through? B: vCIO roadmap/budget; CSM cadence & approvals? C: CSM QBR & initiative intake; TAM lifecycle inputs? D: TAM Service Reviews; AM renewal hygiene? Keep AM vs CSM distinct in RACI even if one person wears both hats: Commercial = AM (Accountable); Health/Cadence = CSM (Accountable).? Automate four core health-triggered plays with owners and due dates.? Make outcomes measurable: recap ≤48h, tasks in system ≤72h, approvals chased within 7–10 days, Joint Success Plan (JSP) - Lite updated.? Treat Service Quality as a TAM-owned Health input that feeds Adoption and Alignment (reviewed in Service Reviews)—do not create a separate sixth Health dimension.? Engage vCTO/vCISO primarily in A (and selectively B) segments when risk/innovation justifies—format/budget may flex, RACI owners do not.What is the Customer impact?? Proper conversation with the right person (Executive QBR with vCIO; Service Review with TAM; QBRs in B/C run by CSM).? Faster decisions: pre-reads and JSP-Lite focus meetings on 1–2 approvals and visible next steps.? Trust through rhythm: predictable cadence and clean follow-through raise Engagement and CX; tighter initiative execution lifts Adoption and Alignment.? Scales without complexity across segments and budgets.Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Segment-Calibrated Role-Deliverable EnablementEnablement mirrors who owns which deliverable in which segment. Give each role only what they need to deliver their outputs for that segment.How to implement (simple):1. Build a one-page matrix: rows = deliverables (Assessment, Report, QBR, Roadmap, Budget, Proposal, Meeting Notes); columns = segments (D/C/B/A).2. Assign RACI Accountable + Backup per cell using TAM, AM/CSM, vCIO (specialists optional in A).3. Attach exactly one talk track, template, checklist, and required data input per cell.4. Define “Done” in one sentence (e.g., “Roadmap B: 1–2 initiatives approved, budget range noted, next checkpoint booked.”).Ownership by segment (examples):? D: TAM Accountable — Service Review report + risks; AM/CSM Backup for renewal dates & CX pulse.? C: CSM Accountable — QBR pack + initiative intake; TAM Backup for DMI/adoption inputs.? B: vCIO Accountable — Roadmap + Budget; CSM Backup for cadence & approvals.? A: vCIO Accountable — Strategy/Executive QBR with OKRs; CSM Backup — governance follow-through.Success metrics: approval landed? Owner/date assigned? Recap ≤48h sent? Health stabilized? Definition of Done by segment (use on the matrix): D = 1 quick win approved + recap ≤48h + next date set; C = 1 approval + DMI/adoption inputs captured + recap ≤48h; B = 1–2 approvals + budget frame noted (this Q + next 2Q) + recap ≤48h; A = ≤2 executive decisions + OKR link visible + recap ≤48h.Concept #2: Live-of-Work Tooling Packs (by role)Each role works from a compact pack used during prep and delivery. Packs cut prep time and reduce variance so a lean CS team can deliver consistently.Pack anatomy (6–8 items):? Playbook (Trigger ? Prep ? Lead ? Follow-up; RACI stamp with Accountable + Backup)? Talk tracks (2–3 prompts)? Templates (3–5 slides or 1–2 pages)? Checklist (prep + recap ≤48h + who/when)? Reports/Alerts/Insights (health, adoption/DMI, SLA)? Service-catalog tiles (pre-scoped initiatives)Put packs where work happens (PSA/CRM/CS tool).Examples:Segment B (Technology Modernization)? vCIO Pack (Accountable: Roadmap & Budget Review) Agenda: re-confirm business goals ? sequence roadmap ? frame budget this Q + next 2 Q ? decision log. Talk tracks: “Two approvals today. Keep the pace we agreed on.” Checklist & assets: roadmap slides, 1-page budget, decision log, DMI snapshot.? CSM Pack (Accountable: QBR cadence & approvals) Agenda: status ? blockers ? approvals. Checklist: Ensure the decision-maker attends; draft the approval email; trigger the play if it is stalled.? TAM Support Pack (Consulted): risk review for upcoming steps.Segment D (Technology Support)? TAM Pack (Accountable: Service Review) Agenda: SLA/incidents ? recurring patterns ? lifecycle snapshot ? 1–2 mini-initiatives. Assets: SLA report, EOL list, quick-wins catalog.? AM/CSM Support: renewal hygiene + close loose ends.Concept #3: QBR Kit + Lightweight Joint Success Plan (JSP-Lite)Make every Strategy/QBR/Service Review outcome-led and fast to run. The kit standardizes what’s shown, what’s decided, and how follow-ups land—so each role can perform confidently by segment and budget.What’s in the kit? Three-slide deck you can reuse:1. Health snapshot (CX, Engagement, Adoption/DMI, Service Quality, Alignment)2. Roadmap/initiatives (progress, blockers, new proposals)3. Decisions & next steps (2 max, owners/dates)? Joint Success Plan (JSP) - Lite (one page) with: business goal ? metric/target ? 2–4 initiatives ? owner ? date ? risks ? next meeting date? Pre-read email template (subject, three bullets, attachments/links)? Recap template (≤48h; summary, decisions, tasks, dates)? RACI stamp on slide 1 (Accountable + Backup + Consulted + Informed)Cadence and Accountable by segment? A (4–5): Annual Strategy Planning + Executive QBR (up to 3/year if budget permits). Accountable: vCIO. Backup: CSM.? B/C (3/2): Annual Strategy Planning + QBR (1–3/year depending on budget). Accountable: CSM. Backup: vCIO (B) / AM (C).? D (1): Annual IT Strategy meeting + Service Reviews. Accountable: TAM. Backup: CSM/AM.How to implement (step by step)1. Save the deck and Joint Success Plan (JSP) - Lite as account templates in your PSA/CRM/CS workspace.2. Add a tiny RACI block to the top right of every agenda and slide 1.3. Timebox prep: ≤60 minutes for any QBR/Strategy/Review.4. Lock the outcomes: aim for 1–2 approvals per session and book the next date before you hang up.5. Recap rhythm: summary ≤48h, tasks in the system ≤72h, approvals chased within 7–10 days.Practical example (Segment B, vCIO + CSM)? Pre-read (sent 72–48h prior): last decisions, today’s two proposed approvals, roadmap excerpt.? Meeting flow: CSM (status/health) ? vCIO (sequence and business value) ? decision 1–2.? Recap: decisions, owners, budget notes, risks flagged to vCISO/vCTO if relevant.What to measure - Approvals per QBR, recap timeliness, “time-to-decision” trend, Health movement next cycle.Common pitfalls - Too many slides, no decision asked, wrong attendees, no RACI on the deck, and recap delays. Concept #4: Health-Triggered CTAs & Playbooks (Automation-First)Turn Health signals into the right owner doing the right small set of actions fast—without re-inventing the wheel every time.Core rules to start (keep it to four):1. Engagement down (missed two touchpoints / no decision in 30 days)? Owner: CSM · Due: 72h? Tasks: 2-line recap ? propose 30-minute reset ? If the executive is missing, cc the vCIO and add the stakeholder.? Output: reset booked, Joint Success Plan (JSP) - Lite updated, next approval attempt scheduled.2. CX down (negative survey or complaint)? Owner: CSM · Due: 48h? Tasks: “we own the miss” call ? 3-point fix plan ? 14-day check-in.? Output: Log the plan, customer acknowledgment, and follow-up on the calendar.3. Adoption/DMI below threshold (e.g., MFA <60% or endpoint compliance <80%)? Owner: TAM · Due: 5 days? Tasks: 3-step remediation ? 15-minute ops sync ? pre-approve quick win before next QBR.? Output: mini-initiative opened, owner/date set, risk reduced.4. Alignment low (“roadmap not relevant”)? Owner: vCIO · Due: 7 days? Tasks: 20-min alignment check ? re-map to business goals ? resequence/cut items.? Output: refreshed roadmap, next decision checkpoint booked.Segment nuance? D/C: quick wins first (catalog items), low lift.? B: Include a budget frame per ask.? A: Ensure exec sponsor attends; keep decisions to two or fewer.How to implement? Create four automation rules in your PSA/CRM/CS tool with owner + due date + tasks.? Prewrite email/snippet text so it’s plug-and-play.? Add a “First Action SLA <72h” widget to your CS dashboard.What to measure - Time-to-first-action, resolution within one cadence cycle, score rebound at the following review.Common pitfalls - Assigning tasks to “the team,” ambiguous due dates, too many rules, and no outcome defined.Concept #5: Two-Track Learning: “In the Flow” + Role CertificationsShorten ramp and stabilize delivery quality with lightweight learning that matches real work, not a heavy academy.Track 1 — In-the-flow learning (always available)? One-page primers per deliverable (what “good” looks like by segment).? 3–5 minute Looms showing a live run-through of prep and recap.? Pre-meeting prompts: “Which decision do we need today?” “Is the decision-maker invited?”? QA rubrics (5 criteria, 1–5 scale): prep completeness, story clarity, decision capture, recap timing, health linkage.Track 2 — Role certification (30/60/90 check-rides)? CSM: observe C QBR ? co-deliver ? lead C QBR (score ≥18/25 on rubric).? TAM: run D Service Review ? log two mini-initiatives ? deliver C lifecycle input block in QBR.? vCIO (new): shadow B ? co-lead B QBR ? lead B roadmap/budget checkpoint.? AM: renewal hygiene walkthrough ? price/terms talk track ? co-present commercial slide in B/C QBR.How to implement? Publish each role’s 90-day plan and book the first check-ride date on day 1.? Store primers, Looms, and rubrics inside the same workspace as the packs.? Tie certification to progression (e.g., CSM certified on C ? eligible to run B under supervision).What to measure - Ramp time to “first solo,” rubric averages, % sessions to standard, rework rate.Common pitfalls - Training not accessible in the flow, no scheduled check-rides, rubrics ignored, promotions without certification.Concept #6 — Digital CS for Segment C/D (Tech-Touch That Still Feels Human)Preserve margins on smaller accounts while keeping cadence, clarity, and perceived value high.Tactics you can run with? Quarterly email + 3-minute screen-recorded video: state of service, top 2 insights, 1–2 recommended quick wins, book-a-slot link.? Auto-reports (SLA, DMI/adoption) with two lines of commentary from the Accountable.? Micro-survey (2 questions) feeding CX Health.? Resource hub: 3–5 curated items (e.g., how to check backups, MFA tips, short policy explainer).? Digital format does not change RACI: Accountable and Backup remain as defined in 5.1 regardless of whether the touch is live or digital.RACI & cadence? D: TAM is accountable for service reviews and quarterly digital touch; CSM Backup is responsible for cadence resets; AM is consulted for renewal timing.? C: CSM is accountable for QBRs and digital touch; TAM provides adoption/DMI inputs; vCIO is optional for escalation.How to implement (pilot 10–15 accounts)? Build a simple list view that shows: last touch date, health, one next ask, and book-a-slot link.? Record a 3-minute recap once per cohort; personalize with the account name, last completed action, and the next ask.? Pre-schedule the quarterly sends; auto-insert the right report snapshots.What to measure - Open/click/book rates, quick-win approval rate, CX pulse trend.Common pitfalls - Generic videos, no next ask, no booking link, trying to replace all meetings instead of mixing formats.Concept #7 — CS Ops-Lite (0.2–0.5 FTE Function or Rotating Duty)Keep templates, packs, playbooks, and health rules tidy and aligned to segments/roles—without creating a big function.Scope & rhythm? Monthly (2–4 hours):? Audit 10 QBR/Review decks: Do they show health, decisions, and recap proof?? Refresh 1–2 templates; verify health rules still fire correctly.? Post a “what changed” note with links.? Quarterly (? day):? Sample 5 accounts/segment for data quality & enablement coverage.? Refresh one playbook; propose two improvements (backlog).Who does it? The CS Lead or senior CSM takes a rotating “Ops-Lite” hat, and the TAM/vCIO lends inputs.Targets - ≥80% sessions to standard; ≥90% recap ≤48h; at least one enablement improvement shipped per quarter.What to measure - Template adoption, play close-rate, first-action SLA hit-rate, data quality spot-checks.Common pitfalls -  No owner, no calendar holds, improvement backlog never shipped, over-engineering dashboards.Concept #8 — Journey-Stage Playbooks (Onboarding ? Adoption ? Value ? Renewal)Make every interaction move the client to the next outcome with 2–3 required artifacts per stage—tuned by segment.Stages, owners, artifacts, exits? Onboarding (D/C) — Accountable: TAM; Backup: CSM? Artifacts: “First 45 days” checklist, asset/lifecycle baseline, stakeholder map.? Exit: Baseline DMI was captured, the first QBR was booked, and the service review rhythm was set.? Adoption (C/B) — Accountable: CSM; Backup: TAM? Artifacts: DMI mini-review, 1–2 quick-win initiatives approved, owner/date in system.? Exit: KPI improved (e.g., MFA to 90%) or initiative started.? Value / QBR (B/A) — Accountable: CSM; Consulted: vCIO (B) / Co-lead: vCIO (A)? Artifacts: QBR kit + Joint Success Plan (JSP) - Lite; decision log.? Exit: 1–2 approvals; budget checkpoint noted; next decision date set.? Renewal — Accountable: AM; Consulted: CSM; Informed: vCIO? Artifacts: realized-value summary, next-year plan (2–4 initiatives).? Exit: renewal confirmed or executive escalation booked.How to implement? Add stage gates to your account view (stage, owner, exit criteria, date).? The artifacts are required to close the stage (links live in the account record).? Tie stage changes to Health nudges (e.g., Adoption ? Value only when a KPI moved).What to measure - Stage conversion %, time-in-stage, initiative throughput, renewal forecast confidence.Common pitfalls - Too many artifacts, unclear stage exits, owners not visible, stage changes not tied to Health.
Implementation ProcessStep 1 — Build the Role?Segment?Deliverable Matrix (1 page)Owner: CS Lead (with one TAM, one CSM, one vCIO)Inputs: 5.1 Roles and Responsibilities (RACI rules), segment cadence (A/B/C/D), Client Segmentation Worksheet – Appetite ? MaturityAction:? Create a 1-page grid: rows = deliverables (Assessments, Reports, Strategy Planning, Executive QBR/QBR, Service Review, Roadmap, Budget, Renewal, Health Dashboard); columns = segments (D, C, B, A).? Assign exactly one Accountable and a named Backup in every cell (RACI). Keep AM = commercial Accountable, CSM = health/cadence Accountable, even if one person wears both hats.? Link each cell to 1 talk track + 1 template + 1 checklist + data inputs.? Add a one-sentence Definition of done per cell (e.g., “B-Roadmap: 1–2 initiatives approved, budget range noted, next checkpoint booked”).? Add a KPI/threshold per cell (e.g., A-Executive QBR: exec attendance ≥95%, decision latency ≤14 days; C-QBR: ≥1 approval; D-Review: ≥1 quick win).Acceptance: Fits on one page; no empty cells; each cell shows Accountable + Backup + asset links; accessible in PSA/CRM/CS workspace (≤2 clicks).Output: “Role?Segment?Deliverable Matrix v1.0” (PDF/Doc with links).Why this matters: implements the segment-calibrated enablement idea (Concept #1).Step 2 — Publish Live-of-Work Packs (by role & segment)Owner: CS Lead; Contributors: one TAM, one CSM, one vCIOInputs: Matrix (Step 1)Action:? Ship two high-impact packs first:? Segment C: CSM QBR Pack (Accountable CSM) + TAM Lifecycle Pack (Backup inputs).? Segment A: vCIO Strategy/Executive QBR Pack (Accountable vCIO) + CSM Portfolio-Follow-Through Pack (Backup CSM).? Each pack includes: Playbook (Trigger?Prep?Lead?Follow-up), RACI stamp, 3–5 slide/template, checklist, reports/alerts/insights, service-catalog tiles, talk tracks.? Pin packs inside the account workspace (shortcuts in PSA/CRM/CS tool).Acceptance: Pack can run a session end-to-end; prep ≤60 minutes; RACI visible on page 1.Output: A- and C-segment packs live; matrix cells link to them.Why this matters: equips roles with the “live-of-work” kit (Concept #2).Step 3 — Standardize the QBR Kit + JSP-LiteTemplate steward (keeps templates current): A/B = vCIO · C = CSM · D = TAM.Meeting delivery Accountable (per Roles/Responsibilities): Executive QBR (A) = vCIO · QBR (B/C) = CSM · Service Review (D/C) = TAM · Annual Strategy Planning (A/B/C) = vCIO.Inputs: Packs (Step 2), cadence rules from Roles/Responsibilities.Action:? Publish 3-slide decks for Strategy/Executive QBR/QBR/Service Review:1.  Health (CX, Engagement, Adoption/DMI, Service Quality, Alignment)2. Roadmap/initiatives (progress, blockers, new asks)3. Decisions & next steps (max 2, owners/dates)? Add Joint Success Plan (JSP) – Lite (1 page): business goal ? metric/target ? 2–4 initiatives ? owner/date ? risks ? next meeting date.? Stamp RACI + named Backup on slide 1 / agenda header. Use these quick stamps:? Executive QBR (A): A = vCIO · R = CSM · C = AM/SMEs · I = TAM · Backup = CSM? QBR (B): A = CSM · C = vCIO, AM · I = TAM/SMEs · Backup = vCIO? QBR (C): A = CSM · C = AM, TAM · I = SMEs · Backup = AM? Service Review (C/D): A = TAM · C = CSM/AM (only if scope/cadence changes) · I = vCIO (C) · Backup = CSM? Lock cadence by segment:? A: Annual Strategy Planning + Executive QBR (up to 3/yr if budget permits)? B/C: Annual Strategy Planning + QBR (1–3/yr by budget)? D: Annual IT Strategy + Service ReviewsAcceptance: Every session saves a JSP-Lite + recap ≤ 48h; ≥ 1 approval per QBR (A/B target = 2). Prep time ≤ 60 minutes using the kit.Output: Deck templates + JSP-Lite stored and linked in the Role?Segment?Deliverable matrix.Why this matters: It makes strategy/QBR/service reviews outcome-led and approvals-oriented, with clear ownership and fast follow-through.Step 4 — Wire Health-Triggered CTAs & Playbooks (automation-first)Owner: CS Lead (with Ops-Lite support)Inputs: Health model (CX, Engagement, Adoption/DMI, Service Quality, Alignment)Action: Create four rules with prebuilt tasks, owners, and due dates:1. Engagement down ? CSM re-engage play (recap ? 30-min reset ? add exec if missing) — due 72h2. CX down ? CSM “we own the miss” plan + 14-day check-in — due 48h3. Adoption/DMI below threshold ? TAM 3-step remediation + 15-min ops sync — due 5 days4. Alignment low ? vCIO 20-min goal check ? resequence/cut — due 7 days Segment nuance: D/C = quick wins first; B = add budget frame; A = exec sponsor present.Acceptance: Task lists auto-create with owner/due; time-to-first-action <72h.Output: 4 active rules; playbooks linked in packs.Why this matters: converts Health signals into concrete actions (Concept #4).Step 5 — Bake Stakeholder Mapping & Invite Logic into TemplatesOwner: CSM (keeps the map current)Inputs: Role?Stakeholder mapping from ResponsibilitiesAction:? Add a Stakeholder block to agendas: Name · Role · Why here · Decision right.? Pre-fill invite lists by meeting type:? Strategy Planning (A/B/C): CEO/CFO + vCIO + CSM; AM consulted; TAM informed.? Executive QBR (A): vCIO + CEO/CFO + CSM; AM consulted; TAM informed.? QBR (B/C): CSM Accountable; B: vCIO consulted; C: TAM consulted; AM consulted for commercial.? Service Review (C/D): TAM Accountable; CSM/AM consulted only if scope/cadence changes.? Add a pre-flight check (48–72h): if the decision-maker will be absent, rescope to a short update and book a decision call.Acceptance: Correct decision-maker in the room ≥90%; rescope path used when needed.Output: Updated agenda templates; stakeholder maps per account.Why this matters: keeps “right people, right topics” and speeds approvals (Concept #3).Step 6 — Launch Two-Track Learning & Role CertificationsOwner: CS LeadInputs: Packs, QBR kit, rubricsAction:? In-flow learning: one-pagers, 3–5 min Looms, pre-meeting prompts, QA rubric (5 criteria: prep completeness, story clarity, decision capture, recap timing, health linkage).? 30/60/90 check-rides:? CSM: observe C QBR ? co-deliver ? lead C QBR (rubric ≥18/25).? TAM: run D Service Review ? log two mini-initiatives ? deliver C lifecycle input.? vCIO: shadow B ? co-lead B ? lead B roadmap/budget.? AM: renewal hygiene ? price/terms talk track ? co-present commercial slide in QBR.? Tie certification to progression (C ? B ? A readiness).Acceptance: Each role has a 90-day plan; the first check-ride is scheduled, and the rubric is used in the first real session.Output: Role ramp guides + rubrics published with the packs.Why this matters: shortens ramp and standardizes outcomes (Concept #5).Step 7 — Switch On Digital CS for C/D (pilot, then scale)Owner: CSM (content) · TAM (data) · CS Lead (approval)Inputs: Health data, SLA/DMI reports, resource hubAction:? Quarterly email + 3-minute screen-recorded video: state of service, top 2 insights, 1–2 quick wins, book-a-slot link.? Attach auto-reports with two-line commentary; include a 2-question micro-survey.? Personalize with account name, last action, and next ask.Acceptance: ≥60% open, ≥10% book rate, ≥1 quick-win approved in pilot.Output: Digital CS flow live for C/D; playbooks documented.Why this matters: preserves margins while keeping cadence and perceived value high (Concept #6).Step 8 — Stand Up CS Ops-Lite + Measure/Report/IterateOwner: Rotating “Ops-Lite” hat (CS Lead or senior CSM)Inputs: Packs, templates, health rules, dashboardAction (Ops-Lite):? Monthly (2–4h): audit 10 sessions (health shown? decisions? recap proof?), refresh 1–2 templates, verify health rules, post “what changed.”? Quarterly (? day): sample 5 accounts/segment for data quality & enablement coverage; refresh one playbook; propose two fixes. Action (Measure/Report):? Enablement adoption: pack usage, prep ≤60 min, % sessions with Joint Success Plan (JSP) - Lite.? Execution quality: recap ≤48h, decisions/QBR, time-to-first-action after health trigger.? Health outcomes: Engagement on cadence, DMI trend, Service Quality signals, and Alignment green rate.? Business outcomes: retention, renewal predictability, initiative-led expansion, NRR (a.k.a. NDR) and GRR tracked; ownership for NRR: AM = Accountable, CSM = Consulted (health), TAM = Responsible (inputs), vCIO = Consulted (A/B roadmap).? Hook into Compensation/Governance: QBR-to-standard, recap timeliness, health-play SLA hit-rate (alongside retention/expansion).Acceptance: ≥80% sessions to standard; ≥90% recap ≤48h; approvals/QBR trending up within a quarter.Output: Monthly enablement snapshot + quarterly improvement log; refreshed packs/templates.Why this matters: keeps enablement current and measurable without “enterprise” overhead (Concepts #7 & #8).

OverviewWhat is the objective?Design a simple, segment-aware compensation model for CS roles (TAM, AM/CSM, vCIO, and—where justified—vCTO/vCISO) that pays for customer outcomes: retention (GRR), healthy growth (NRR), and visible Health improvements. Keep it calculable monthly and payable quarterly for a 10–150 person MSP, while preserving the advisory neutrality of strategic roles.Note: NRR (a.k.a. NDR) and GRR (a.k.a. GDR) aliases are treated equivalently for targets and payout math.Why is it important?? Compensation drives behaviour: the plan aligns day-to-day actions to renewals, right-sized expansion, and Health.? Prevents misalignment: no pay for raw activity (tickets/meetings) without outcomes that customers feel in QBRs.? Protects strategy: vCIO stays an unbiased advisor (no deal commissions).? Fair across segments: ops-heavy D/C aren’t over-bonused; A/B strategic work is recognized.? Easy to run: 3–4 metrics/role, Green/Yellow/Red thresholds, one quarterly payout.? Direct line-of-sight to the CS north star: variable components ladder to portfolio NRR/GRR with Health as a guardrail.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Make renewals predictable (AM/CSM variable on GRR/NRR with a light Health guardrail).? Lift adoption and quality (TAM variable tied to SLA trend, Adoption/DMI movement, lifecycle hygiene).? Keep strategy strategic (vCIO variable on portfolio outcomes: NRR, OKR/roadmap progress, Alignment).? Track simply and pay reliably (one spreadsheet calculator; monthly snapshots from CS tool/PSA/CRM/Billing).? Handle mixed hats cleanly (blended weights—for example, 30% AM / 70% vCIO—on one payslip).? Honor RACI ownership from 5.1/5.2 in crediting: NRR ? AM Accountable; CSM Consulted (Health), TAM Responsible (inputs), vCIO Consulted (A/B roadmap).What is the Customer impact?? Advisory over pressure: strategic reviews stay outcome-led, not sales-led.? Better QBRs: decisions and progress get rewarded, not slide count.? Higher reliability: incentives reinforce lifecycle hygiene, SLA consistency, and adoption follow-through.? Stronger trust and growth: pay aligns with the value customers experience, improving renewals and right-sized expansion.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Pay for outcomes, not output (anchor on GDR/GRR and NDR/NRR)Typical MSP cases solved? Teams rack up meetings or tickets, but renewals don’t improve.? Expansion is pushed before the customer sees value or adopts the basics.How to apply? Make revenue-retention your primary levers: GRR/GDR = revenue kept (excluding expansion); NRR/NDR = revenue kept plus expansion/downgrades.? Track monthly in a simple sheet; pay quarterly. Limit each role to 3–4 metrics.? Credit expansion occurs only when a decision is captured in the QBR/JSP-Lite with the owner, date, and budget.? Use “decision latency” (days from proposal to approved decision) as a quality modifier for CSM/AM; A-segment Green ≤14 days (see KPI workbook).Practical examples? AM/CSM variable (quarterly): 60% GRR/GDR vs target, 40% NRR/NDR vs target.? Green/Yellow/Red example thresholds: GRR ≥95% = Green, 92–94.9% = Yellow, <92% = Red. NRR ≥102% = Green, 100–101.9% = Yellow, <100% = Red.? A-segment stretch box (portfolio): NRR ≥120% = Green; exec attendance ≥95% (credit gate); adoption depth ≥85%.What to measure? Monthly GRR/NRR snapshot by account and portfolio; QBR decisions logged; expansion dollars tied to approved initiatives.Common pitfalls? Paying for activity volume (meetings/tickets) with no link to retention.? Crediting expansion without QBR evidence or when engagement is weak.Concept #2: Role-clear levers — AM/CSM are commercial; vCIO stays advisory; TAM anchors quality & adoptionTypical MSP cases solved? vCIOs chase commissions and lose strategic trust.? TAMs don’t get credit for adoption and lifecycle hygiene, which makes renewals possible.How to apply? AM/CSM: variable tied to GRR/NRR, plus a light Health guardrail.? vCIO: no deal-by-deal commission; variable tied to portfolio outcomes across A/B (NRR, roadmap/OKR progress, Alignment).? TAM: variable tied to Service Quality trend, Adoption/DMI movement, and lifecycle completeness.? Digital touches (video/email) count the same as live sessions if the QBR/JSP-Lite “credit gate” is met.Practical examples? AM/CSM (quarterly): 60% GRR/GDR, 25% NRR/NDR, 15% Health guardrail (Engagement/CX not Red).? vCIO (annual, tracked quarterly): 50% portfolio NRR/NDR, 30% roadmap/OKR milestones accepted in QBRs, 20% Service Level Alignment trend.? TAM (quarterly): 40% SLA/resolution trend, 40% Adoption/DMI delta, 20% lifecycle completeness.What to measure? SLA/resolution trends, DMI/adoption %, Alignment colour, portfolio NRR/GRR by segment.Common pitfalls? Mixing sales commissions into vCIO pay.? Giving TAMs generic CSAT only, ignoring adoption/lifecycle outcomes.Concept #3: Segment-aware compensation (D?A)Typical MSP cases solved? Overpaying for reactive work in low-margin D/C accounts.? Under-rewarding high-effort strategic work in B/A accounts.How to apply? Keep metric types consistent across segments, change weights and thresholds with maturity.? Salary/variable mix gets more strategic as you move up the segments.? Mirror 5.2 “Definition of Done” by segment when setting Green thresholds (e.g., D = ≥1 quick win approved + recap ≤48h; C = ≥1 approval + recap ≤48h; B = 1–2 approvals + budget frame noted; A = ≤2 executive decisions + OKR link).Practical examples? Segment D (Goal 1—Support): 80% salary / 20% variable on SLA trend + CX; small retention guardrail.? Segment C (Goal 2—Enablement): 80/20; variable on Adoption/DMI trend + initiative approvals.? Segment B (Goal 3—Modernization): 75/25; variable on roadmap adoption, proposal velocity, and budget cadence.? Segment A (Goals 4–5—Transformation/Innovation): 85/15; variable on portfolio NRR, OKR progress, Alignment staying Green.What to measure? Thresholds by segment (e.g., Adoption Green in C = DMI +10 points quarter-over-quarter).Common pitfalls? One flat plan for all clients, regardless of maturity or margin.? Rewarding the same behaviours in D as in A.Concept #4: Include a small, shared Health component (simple · predictive · actionable)Typical MSP cases solved? “Revenue at any cost” behaviour hurts experience and long-term retention.? Leaders can’t spot early risk when cadence/adoption slips.How to apply? Dedicate 10–20% of the variables to health signals the team can influence weekly: Engagement (on-course with the right people), adoption/DMI trend, service quality trend, and alignment.? Use a colour model with clear, segment-specific thresholds.? A-segment guardrail: if Executive QBR attendance (CEO/CFO) <95% in a quarter, expansion credit from A accounts is deferred until a decision meeting occurs.Practical examples? Engagement Green = last QBR held on schedule with decision-maker present and recap ≤48h; Yellow = late or no decision-maker once; Red = late twice or no decision-maker twice.? Guardrail: if Engagement is Red for 2+ months, expansion $ from that account doesn’t count toward NRR that quarter; credit returns when Engagement is back to Yellow/Green, and a QBR resets next steps.What to measure? Monthly Health colours, time-to-first-action after a Health trigger, rebound by next cadence.Common pitfalls? There are too many health inputs and thresholds that no one understands.? Treating Health as a report, not a trigger for CTAs/Playbooks.Concept #5: Simple measurement: monthly Green/Yellow/Red, one quarterly payout, target 80% GreenTypical MSP cases solved? Scorecards no one can compute; endless disputes about “what counts.”How to apply? Set G/Y/R thresholds per metric; update one page per person monthly; aim for ~80% Green mid-quarter.? Pay once per quarter with a transparent formula.? Apply the same formula to blended roles by weighting the underlying role plans (see Concept #7).Practical examples? Payout math: Paid Variable = Target Bonus ? (0.5 ? %Green + 0.25 ? %Yellow).? Reds trigger coaching/enablement actions, not ad-hoc exceptions.What to measure? %Green/%Yellow/%Red per role, per person; correlation to GRR/NRR.Common pitfalls? Paying monthly (too noisy for SMB MSPs).? Over-weighting Yellow so mediocre months pay like great ones. Concept #6: QBR remains the evidence anchor in MSPsTypical MSP cases solved? Slide-heavy reviews with no decisions; disputes about whether value was delivered.? Expansion is credited before outcomes are accepted.How to apply? Use QBR/JSP-Lite artifacts to confirm decisions and progress.? Make “credit gates” explicit: decision captured with owner, date, and budget in QBR notes, or it doesn’t count.? Digital QBRs/email+video recaps qualify if the credit gate fields are present and the recap is sent ≤48h.Practical examples? Count expansion only when the initiative is approved in QBR and scheduled (owner/date in system).? Evidence first slide: Health snapshot ? Roadmap progress ? Decisions (max 2) with owners/dates.What to measure? Approvals per QBR, time-to-decision, % sessions with saved JSP-Lite + recap ≤48h.Common pitfalls? Crediting “verbal approvals.”? No owner/date/budget in notes; no recap within 48 hours.Concept #7: Mixed roles get blended weights (e.g., 30% AM / 70% vCIO)Typical MSP cases solved? Small teams wear multiple hats; incentives pull in different directions.How to apply? One plan, one calculator: Payout = 0.3 ? AM plan + 0.7 ? vCIO plan (example).? Keep thresholds identical to the role plans; publish the split on the scorecard.? Blends must follow RACI credit rules (e.g., NRR counted toward AM component; roadmap/Alignment toward vCIO component).Practical examples? “Strategy Consultant (AM 30% / vCIO 70%)”: same quarterly cadence; AM metrics (GRR/NRR) blended with vCIO metrics (portfolio NRR, OKR milestones, Alignment trend).What to measure? Actual account mix vs. intended split; payout alignment with time spent by segment.Common pitfalls? Two separate plans and two payouts.? Double-counting expansion across AM and vCIO.Concept #8: Ground base salary in MSP benchmarks; let this blueprint govern the variableTypical MSP cases solved? Debates about “fair base” derail the comp conversation.? Using SaaS salary data that doesn’t fit MSP margins.How to apply? Use MSP/TSP market reports for base ranges by role and region; review annually.? Keep variable logic here segment-aware and outcome-tied; don’t over-engineer.Practical examples (typical targets; tune to your margins/region)? TAM: 10–15% variable.? CSM/AM: 15–25% variable.? vCIO: 10–20% variable (annual, tracked quarterly), no deal commission.? Specialists (vCISO/vCTO when used): match vCIO style—portfolio outcomes, not per-deal commission.What to measure? Offer acceptance vs. market; retention of high performers; variable as a % of gross margin.Common pitfalls? Changing the base mid-year to fix behaviour (use variable weights/thresholds instead).? Setting the variable so high encourages short-term pushes over long-term retention.
Implementation ProcessAligning incentives to client outcomes with segment-aware, health-guardrail scorecardsStep 1 — Define 3–4 outcomes per role (one-page scorecards)Owner: CS Lead with FinanceInputs: 5.1 Roles, 5.2 Responsibilities, 5.3 Enablement, current segment mix (A/B/C/D), revenue targetsAction:? Pick 3–4 metrics max for each role and write plain-English definitions + Green/Yellow/Red thresholds.? AM/CSM: GRR/GDR, NRR/NDR, Health guardrail (Engagement/CX not Red), QBR evidence present.? vCIO: Portfolio NRR/NDR (A/B accounts), roadmap/OKR milestones accepted in QBRs, Service Level Alignment trend.? TAM: SLA/resolution trend, Adoption/DMI delta, lifecycle completeness.? Add a Mixed Role line (e.g., “30% AM / 70% vCIO”) so blended plans are just weighted averages.? Put everything on one page per role.? Include “decision latency” and Exec QBR attendance (A-segment) as quality modifiers pulled from the KPI sheet.Acceptance:? ≤4 metrics per role, each with a clear definition and G/Y/R thresholds.? Anyone can explain the scorecard in 2 minutes.Output: Role scorecards v1 (one-pagers).Why this matters: Locks “pay for outcomes” and keeps advisory/commercial/quality levers role-clear (Concepts #1, #2).Step 2 — Tie scorecards to segments and set payout cadencesOwner: CS LeadInputs: Segment rules (A/B/C/D), meeting cadence, margin targets, Client Segmentation (Appetite ? Maturity) worksheetAction:? Create a simple “Segment ? Weights” table per role (D/C/B/A rows; weights for each metric as columns).? Set the salary/variable mix by segment (e.g., D is more salary-heavy; A is tied to portfolio outcomes).? Set payout cadence: AM/CSM/TAM quarterly; vCIO annual (tracked quarterly).? Define eligibility basics (proration for new hires, leave, partial quarter).? Copy the “Definition of Done by segment” from 5.2 into the Threshold Library to standardize Green.Acceptance:? One page maps segments to weights and cadence; no exceptions needed to run payroll.Output: Segment?Weight Map (posted next to scorecards).Why this matters: Aligns incentives to client maturity and effort without creating different plans per client (Concept #3).Step 3 — Build one calculator and the Green/Yellow/Red thresholdsOwner: Finance (with CS Lead)Inputs: Scorecards + Segment?Weight Map + KPI thresholds (exec attendance, decision latency, adoption depth)Action:? Make a single spreadsheet (or Google Sheet) with tabs:1. Threshold Library (role metrics with G/Y/R),2. Role Calcs (AM/CSM, TAM, vCIO),3. Mixed Roles (blend = weight ? role plan),4. Person Summary (per-person payout).? Use a transparent formula, e.g.: Paid Variable = Target Bonus ? (0.5 ? %Green + 0.25 ? %Yellow)? Encode guardrails: e.g., if Engagement = Red for 2+ months, expansion from that account doesn’t count toward NRR this quarter (auto-flag).? Preload example GRR/NRR math so Finance and CS calculate the same way.? Add A-segment gates: Exec attendance <95% or decision latency >14 days ? defer expansion credit until resolved.Acceptance:? Data entry <30 minutes/month; the sheet returns one payout number per person.? Anyone can audit where a number came from in 3 clicks.Output: Compensation Calculator v1.Why this matters: Removes disputes and keeps the plan compute-light (Concepts #4, #5, #7).Step 4 — Map metrics to data sources and set the QBR “credit gate”Owner: CS Ops-Lite (or Finance if Ops-Lite doesn’t exist) Inputs: CS tool/PSA/CRM/Billing exports, Health dashboard, QBR/JSP-Lite templateAction:? Create a one-page Data Map: GRR/NRR ? which export/fields; Health ? which indicators; SLA/Adoption ? which reports.? Schedule a monthly snapshot day; save CSVs to a shared folder.? Add a “credit gate” block to the QBR template: a decision only counts when notes show decision, owner, date, and budget.? Add a short “Where numbers come from” appendix to the calculator (field names and links).? State explicitly that digital QBRs count if credit-gate fields are present and recap ≤48h.Acceptance:? Every metric has one link to its source; QBR evidence fields exist and are used.Output: Data Map + QBR Credit Gate guide.Why this matters: Keeps credit tied to outcomes customers actually accepted in QBRs (Concept #6).Step 5 — Set a lightweight governance rhythmOwner: CS Lead (Finance invited for 10 minutes)Inputs: Calculator snapshots, Health view, exceptions listAction:? Monthly (30–45 min): review each person’s G/Y/R mix, note coaching/enablement needs, and confirm any Health guardrails triggered.? Quarterly: close numbers after the QBR cycle ends; approve payouts for AM/CSM/TAM; review vCIO progress (pay annually).? Annually: adjust thresholds/weights only once; don’t change rules mid-year.? Review A-segment attendance/latency flags as part of the quarterly close before granting expansion credit.Acceptance:? Reviews happen on the calendar, payouts are on time, and there are no ad-hoc plan edits in mid-quarter.Output: Calendar holds + a 1-page “Comp Review Notes” per quarter.Why this matters: Predictable reviews drive behaviour and reduce noise (Concept #5).Step 6 — Pilot ? Parallel Run ? Go-LiveOwner: CS Lead with Finance Inputs: Steps 1–5 completedAction:? Pilot one quarter with AM/CSM on B/C segments (10–20 accounts).? Parallel run one more quarter (calculate but don’t pay) to tune thresholds and the Health guardrail.? Go-live in the following quarter; publish the final plan and stop exceptions.? Include at least one A-segment account in parallel run to validate exec-attendance and latency gates.Acceptance:? Pilot and parallel results were documented; there were fewer than two threshold tweaks before they went live.Output: Signed Compensation Plan v1.0 + archived pilot sheets.Why this matters: Changes behaviour safely without whiplash (Concepts #1–#5).Step 7 — Publish the starter kit so everyone can self-serveOwner: CS LeadInputs: Final plan, calculator, templatesAction:? Post a simple pack in your workspace:? Scorecard templates (AM/CSM, vCIO, TAM, Mixed).? Threshold Library by segment (what’s Green/Yellow/Red).? QBR note template with the credit-gate block.? “Where numbers come from” one-pager (exports/fields).? FAQ (eligibility, proration, mixed roles, dispute window).? Add a 10-minute Loom walking through a worked example.? Add a “Credit Gate Quick Check” slide for digital touches (what qualifies / what doesn’t).Acceptance:? New hires can understand their plan in one sitting; managers can run the math solo.Output: Compensation Starter Kit v1 (shared folder + links in the calculator).Why this matters: Keeps the system durable and low-touch as you grow (Concepts #2, #7, #8).
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?LevelCompensation Focus1.1 Technology SupportSalary-heavy with a small SLA/Service Quality variable and a simple CX/Engagement guardrail. Renewal hygiene only, no activity pay.1.2 Technology EnablementIntroduces GRR/GDR with a Health guardrail (Engagement/CX) and cadence discipline. No CSAT-only bonuses; evidence comes from QBR notes.1.3 Technology ModernizationVariable tied to Adoption/Health (e.g., DMI/adoption trend), initiative approvals and budget cadence, with QBR evidence (decision, owner, date).1.4 Business TransformationGoals-based comp is tied to portfolio outcomes (NRR/NDR), roadmap/OKR progress, and alignment. Advisory roles remain non-commissioned.1.5 Business InnovationStrategic levers: portfolio-level NRR/NDR, OKR contribution, and co-managed innovation milestones for Segment A accounts, evidenced in Executive QBRs.Segment A target box (align with KPI workbook): exec attendance ≥95%; decision latency ≤14 days; adoption depth ≥85%; portfolio NRR ≥120%.How does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Client Business Goal – Comp weights shift with client maturity: D focuses on stability (SLA/CX guardrail), C on adoption and basic approvals, B on roadmap/budget progress, A on portfolio outcomes and OKR progress.? 2. Customer Success Health – A small shared Health component (Engagement, Adoption/DMI, Service Quality, Alignment) acts as an early, actionable guardrail.? 3. Customer Success Delivery – Rewards are tied to outcomes evidenced in QBRs/JSP-Lite (decision, owner, date, budget), not meeting or ticket volume.? 4. Customer Success Process – Cadence adherence and simple playbook follow-through can be lightly incentivized, especially in early maturity.? 5. Customer Success People – Mirrors Roles & Responsibilities: AM/CSM = commercial (GRR/GDR, NRR/NDR), vCIO = advisory with portfolio outcomes (no deal commission), TAM = quality/adoption. Uses Enablement artifacts (QBR kit + JSP-Lite, recap ≤48h) as the credit gate.? 7. Customer Success Strategy – Segment-aware comp prevents over-servicing low-margin tiers and aligns incentives where strategic impact is realistic.Data & RACI alignment: metric ownership/credit follows the RACI map from 5.1/5.2; digital vs. live format does not change credit if the gate is met.Product Links / Tooling SupportNot yet available in LMx.

OverviewWhat is the objective?To create a lightweight, segment-aware operating system that keeps Customer Success coordinated, measurable, and improving across your MSP. Governance defines how roles stay accountable, how processes and “campaigns” (e.g., security rollouts) are run, which data is trusted and reviewed, what tools are used, how OKRs are set and tracked, and how internal meetings drive action—so QBRs, roadmaps, and Health work the same way for every client, every quarter.Align governance explicitly to the CS north star: NRR/NDR and GRR/GDR are treated as equivalent aliases in all reports, gates, and decisions.Digital touches (email + 3-min video, digital QBR) are fully valid if “credit-gate” fields are present; format does not change ownership or evidence rules.Why is it important?? Prevents “random acts of CS”: the same playbooks, evidence, and decisions are in every QBR—backed by agreed metrics and owners. ? Turns Health into action: changes in Engagement, Adoption/DMI, CX, or Alignment automatically trigger CTAs/plays, not debates. ? Protects strategic conversations: advisory roles (e.g., vCIO) are measured on portfolio outcomes and OKRs—not ticket volume or deal commissions. ? Scales a small CS team: a clear cadence and CS Ops habits reduce heroics and keep execution consistent as you grow.? Ensures RACI from 5.1/5.2 is visible in every forum (Accountable + named Backup) and that Compensation (5.3) crediting follows those same owners.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Make QBRs decisive, not performative: standard agendas, decision logs, and follow-ups tie every recommendation to business outcomes.? Run service “campaigns” cleanly: before you push a stack change (e.g., MFA), align owners, success criteria, timing, and the joint client message.? See the truth weekly/monthly: one Health + retention view (GRR/NRR) with simple Green/Yellow/Red rules—no spreadsheet archaeology.? Keep tools from owning you: declare the handful of systems of record (CS tool/PSA/CRM, Health, files) and the reports each one must produce.? Set and keep OKRs: lightweight CS OKRs drive quarterly focus across A/B clients (strategy) and C/D clients (stability/adoption).? Adopt KPI gates from the attachments: Segment A exec attendance ≥95% and decision latency ≤14 days; track and enforce via the governance rhythm.What is the Customer impact?? Clear, repeatable experience: clients see the same reliable rhythm—prep ? QBR ? decisions ? delivery—regardless of who attends. ? Faster value realization: adoption gaps surface early; following initiatives are approved sooner; outcomes are documented and revisited.? Executive-level confidence: QBRs focus on results and risk, not activity lists—building trust and renewal readiness.? No friction from format changes: digital or live, the same standards and owners apply.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Role & Responsibility Clarity (RACI-by-Segment one-pager)When account work “floats” between AM/CSM, TAM, and vCIO, tactical items pile onto senior people, strategic A/B accounts slip; onboarding and QBRs become personality-driven instead of predictable. A simple, segment-specific RACI makes decision rights explicit and keeps senior roles focused on the right clients. Publish a single living page per segment that names the Accountable owner for each recurring deliverable (QBR, Roadmap, Budget, Adoption/DMI review), plus Responsible/Consulted/Informed. This mirrors how mature MSPs divide AM vs. vCIO work and how QBR/vCIO motions are meant to run.Include a Named Backup for every Accountable, per 5.1, and cross-reference the CS Function Role Mapping so compensation crediting in 5.3 follows the same owner.Practical example? Segment C: QBR ? ? CSM (Accountable), TAM (Consulted – lifecycle inputs), AM (Consulted – commercial)? Adoption/DMI ? CSM (Accountable – initiative follow-through), TAM (Responsible – assessment/config inputs)? Segment A/B: Roadmap & Budget ? vCIO (Accountable), CSM (Responsible – cadence & approvals), AM (Consulted – commercial), TAM (Consulted – risk/tech).? Put the four RACIs (A, B, C, D) in your playbooks; review quarterly and align the A-owner to compensation measures.Concept #2: Process & Campaign Governance (from intake ? close)Many MSPs run “random acts of projects” — stack upgrades or security pushes start without shared messaging, owners, or success criteria; QBRs list activity but not decisions or next steps. Standardize every portfolio initiative with Pre-Flight ? In-Flight ? Close-Out so campaigns are consistent across segments and traceable in QBRs. This matches proven vCIO/QBR workflows (assessments, exec summaries, roadmap, budgets) used by strategic MSPs.Use the 5.2 “Definition of Done” by segment as acceptance criteria (e.g., B: 1–2 approvals + budget frame; A: ≤2 exec decisions + OKR link).Enforce the QBR “credit-gate”: decision, owner, date, and budget must be present in the notes/JSP-Lite—digital and live formats treated equally.Practical example? Pre-Flight (30 min): define target segments, talk tracks, service-catalog item, RACI, timeline, and success criteria.? In-Flight (weekly 15 min): count initiatives created/approved/delivered, clear blockers, confirm owners.? Close-Out: document outcomes, update the playbook & service-catalog entry.? QBR credit gate: expansion/roadmap credit counts only if the QBR note shows owner + date + budget.Concept #3: Health ? Playbooks Automation (alerts create tasks)Health signals often sit in a dashboard no one opens. Dips in CX, Engagement, Adoption/DMI, or Alignment should automatically create tasks with clear owners and due dates—so the right person runs a small, repeatable play without debate. This aligns with Enablement Concept #4 and keeps actions fast and consistent.Treat Service Quality as a TAM-owned input feeding Adoption/Alignment (do not add a sixth Health dimension).Track “First Action SLA <72h” on all triggered CTAs.Practical exampleDefine four core triggers (automation-first) and two optional ones. Each trigger = Owner + Due-by window + 3–4 step play + expected output.? Engagement down (missed two touchpoints or no decision in 30 days) Owner: CSM · Due: 72h Play: send 2-line recap ? propose 30-min reset ? add/mobilize the exec if missing. Output: reset booked; JSP-Lite updated; next approval attempt scheduled.? CX down (negative pulse) Owner: CSM · Due: 48h Play: “We own the miss” call ? write 3-point fix plan ? book 14-day check-in. Output: plan logged; client acknowledged; follow-up on calendar.? Adoption/DMI below threshold (e.g., MFA <60% or endpoint compliance <80%) Owner: TAM · Due: 5 days Play: run 3-step remediation ? 15-min ops sync ? pre-approve one quick win before next QBR. Output: mini-initiative opened with owner/date; risk reduced.? Alignment low (“roadmap not relevant”) Owner: vCIO · Due: 7 days Play: 20-minute goal check ? re-map to business goals ? resequence/cut items. Output: refreshed roadmap; next decision checkpoint booked.? Optional (use if helpful)? Missed SLA threshold ? TAM · Due: 5 days · Play: root-cause + client comms ? Output: fix plan sent.? Stakeholder change ? CSM · Due: 10 days · Play: new exec intro + value recap ? Output: sponsor confirmed.Segment nuance? D/C: prioritize quick-win catalog items (low lift).? B: Add a budget frame to each ask.? A: Ensure executive sponsor is present; keep approvals to a maximum of two.How to implement? Create the four automation rules in your PSA/CRM/CS tool with owner, due date, and the play’s task checklist pre-filled; keep the two optional rules in draft for later.? Prewrite email/snippet text so plays are plug-and-play.? Add a “First Action SLA <72h” widget to the CS dashboard.What to measure: Time-to-first-action; resolution within one cadence cycle; score rebound by following review.Common pitfalls: Assigning to “the team” instead of a named owner; vague due dates; too many rules; no defined output.Concept #4: Data & Reporting Cadence (one source of truth)Weekly firefighting happens because data is scattered across PSA, sheets, and inboxes; teams don’t share one trustworthy view of Health, QBR completion, or initiative status. Pick systems of record and set a weekly + monthly reporting rhythm everyone uses: PSA for tickets/projects, CS/Health workspace for CX/Engagement/Adoption/Alignment, and a simple finance roll-up for GRR/NRR. MSP best practice is to anchor operational truth in the PSA and layer CS/health and finance views on top.Add two KPI gates portfolio-wide (from the KPI workbook): (1) Executive attendance rate in Segment A; (2) Decision latency from proposal to approved decision; display both on the Monthly Portfolio dashboard.Normalize NRR/NDR and GRR/GDR in reporting (one label in UI, both accepted in inputs).Flag qualifying digital QBRs identically if credit-gate fields are present and recap ≤48h.Practical example? Weekly CS Ops (30 min): top 10 accounts by Health delta; assign the matching playbook; confirm due dates.? Monthly portfolio (60 min): Segment A/B/C/D dashboard — GRR/NRR trend, QBR completion %, Adoption/DMI trend, open initiatives by stage.Concept #5: Tooling Governance (declare the stack & handoffs)Notes, approvals, and assets often land in the wrong place, so nothing reconciles. Publish a one-page “What lives where”: PSA = tickets/projects/SLA; CRM = contacts/opps; CS/Health = scores, CTAs, playbooks; Documentation = SOPs/diagrams. Map handoffs so QBR notes and approvals flow into the right system (automation if possible, checklist if not). Consolidating around PSA/CRM/CS tools is the norm for MSPs, and reporting is kept reliable.Embed three template blocks everywhere: (a) RACI stamp (Accountable + Backup), (b) Stakeholder block (Name · Role · Decision right), (c) Credit-gate fields (decision, owner, date, budget).Store JSP-Lite and digital recaps in the same system of record as live QBRs.Practical example (ready to copy)? Add a 5-item data hygiene checklist to every QBR/roadmap template: (1) attendees recorded (CRM), (2) Health snapshot filed (CS tool), (3) decisions + owners (PSA project/initiative), (4) budget placeholder (PSA/finance), (5) next cadence set (calendar).? Audit one account per segment monthly; fix gaps before quarter end.Concept #6: Lightweight OKRs that fit MSP CS (quarterly)Goals often become activity lists (e.g., “do more meetings”) instead of outcomes tied to retention and modernization. Use quarterly, lightweight OKRs at team and role level (1–3 Objectives; 2–4 measurable KRs), scored monthly; expect ~70% success as a healthy stretch. This format is widely adopted because it aligns day-to-day execution to customer outcomes without a heavy process. Link at least one KR per quarter to NRR/GRR movement and one to decision latency/exec attendance where applicable (Segments A/B).Practical example (ready to copy)? Team OKR (Q): “Increase portfolio retention confidence.”? KR1: QBR completion ≥95% in A, ≥90% in B/C.? KR2: +8-pt average Adoption/DMI gain in C accounts with open initiatives.? Role OKR (vCIO, A/B): “Advance strategic outcomes.”? KR1: ≥75% of approved roadmap items delivered on time.? KR2: Exec CX +5 points in A accounts.Concept #7: Meeting Rhythm that enforces accountabilityInternal reviews are irregular, so playbooks stall and risks linger until renewal. Set a simple, repeatable cadence that clears blockers and keeps Health-triggered CTAs moving, tied to your QBR rhythm. MSP guidance emphasizes predictable review forums around QBR content and AM/vCIO handoffs.Add “credit-gate check” to Weekly AM/CSM and Monthly Portfolio agendas; treat digital and live sessions the same.Review any A-segment exec-attendance or latency breaches before counting expansion in the quarter.Practical example? Weekly AM/CSM (30 min): next 14 days of QBRs — agenda, assets, “ask,” and follow-ups assigned.? Weekly CS Ops (20 min): data freshness check, trigger audits, field corrections.? Monthly Segment Review (60 min): heatmap (Health, GRR/NRR, backlog); reassign owners; launch/close campaigns.? Quarterly Portfolio (90 min): OKR score, playbook updates, compensation calibration based on agreed metrics.
Implementation ProcessStep 1 — Publish RACI-by-Segment (the one-pager set)Goal: End role drift; make accountability visible for every recurring CS deliverable.Owner: CS Lead (with AM/CSM, TAM, vCIO input)Do this? Create four single-page RACIs (Segments A, B, C, D). For each deliverable (QBR, Roadmap, Budget, Adoption/DMI Review, Initiative Intake, Decision Log), mark A/R/C/I across TAM, AM/CSM, vCIO, and Specialists.? Keep A/B strategic: vCIO is Accountable for Roadmap/Budget in A/B; C/D tactical: TAM is Accountable for Adoption/DMI in C/D.? Post the four pages inside your playbooks and share them on the team channel.? Add a Named Backup in every RACI cell and mirror the CS Function Role Mapping; ensure 5.3 crediting references the same Accountable.Definition of done? RACI (A–D) published that each A (Accountable) owner has a matching metric on their scorecard (ties to Compensation).Step 2 — Standardize Process & Campaign Governance (Pre-Flight ? In-Flight ? Close-Out)Goal: Make initiatives (e.g., MFA rollout, stack upgrades) repeatable and traceable.Owner: CS Lead (vCIO leads for A/B; CSM for C; TAM for D).Do this? Pre-Flight (template): target segments, value story and talk tracks, service-catalog entry, RACI, timeline, success criteria.? In-Flight (15-min weekly huddle): initiated/approved/delivered counts, blockers, and subsequent owner.? Close-Out: outcomes vs. plan; update the playbook and the catalog item; capture lessons learned.? Add a QBR credit gate: an initiative “counts” only if the QBR Decision Log shows owner + date + budget.? Use 5.2 “Definition of Done by segment” to set Green thresholds for each campaign.Definition of done? One unified campaign template + live tracker; last QBRs show decisions captured.Step 3 — Fix Data & Reporting Cadence (one source of truth)Goal: Everyone sees the same Health and portfolio reality weekly and monthly.Owner: CS Ops (or the CS Lead if Ops doesn’t exist)Do this? Declare Systems of Record:? PSA: tickets, projects, SLA metrics, initiative tasks? CS/Health workspace: CX, Engagement, Adoption/DMI, Alignment, Health triggers & CTAs? CRM/Finance: stakeholders, GRR/NRR roll-up? Ship two views and stick to them:? Weekly CS Ops (30 min): top Health deltas (G/Y/R), playbook assigned, due date set.? Monthly Portfolio (60 min): Segment A/B/C/D dashboard — GRR/NRR trend, QBR completion %, Adoption/DMI trend, open initiatives by stage.? Add KPI tiles for A-segment exec attendance and decision latency; normalize NRR/NDR and GRR/GDR labels.? Mark digital QBRs as “credit-gate met” when fields + ≤48h recap are present.Definition of done? Dashboards exist; meetings are on the calendar; the last 2 weeks show Health deltas ? CTAs with owners.Step 4 — Tooling Governance (declare the stack & handoffs)Goal: Notes/approvals land in the right place; nothing gets lost between tools.Owner: CS Ops (with CS tool/PSA/CRM admin)Do this? Publish a one-page “What lives where” map for PSA, CRM, CS/Health, and Documentation.? Add a 5-item data-hygiene checklist to every QBR/Roadmap template:1. Attendees recorded (CRM)2. Health snapshot attached (CS tool)3. decisions + owners logged (CS tool/PSA)4. budget placeholder (CS tool/PSA/Finance)5. Next cadence booked (calendar)? Automate where possible; use a simple checklist where not.? Embed RACI stamp, Stakeholder block, and Credit-gate fields on slide 1 / agenda header; store JSP-Lite alongside digital recaps.Definition of done? The map was published; one account per segment was audited monthly, and gaps were fixed before the quarter end.Step 5 — Health ? Playbooks Automation (alerts create tasks)Goal: Turn Health from a dashboard into action without heroics.Owner: CS Ops (rules) + Role owners (execution)Do thisStand up four core, automation-first triggers and keep two optional ones ready. Each trigger auto-creates a CTA with owner, due-by, and checklist:? Engagement down (missed two touchpoints / no decision in 30 days) Owner: CSM · Due: 72h Play: 2-line recap ? propose 30-min reset ? add/mobilize exec if missing. Output: reset booked; JSP-Lite updated; next approval attempt scheduled.? CX down (negative pulse) Owner: CSM · Due: 48h Play: “We own the miss” call ? 3-point fix plan ? 14-day check-in. Output: plan logged; client acknowledged; follow-up on calendar.? Adoption/DMI below threshold (e.g., MFA <60% or endpoint <80%) Owner: TAM · Due: 5 days Play: 3-step remediation ? 15-min ops sync ? pre-approve one quick win. Output: mini-initiative opened with owner/date; risk reduced.? Alignment low (“roadmap not relevant”) Owner: vCIO · Due: 7 days Play: 20-minute goal check ? re-map to business goals ? resequence/cut items. Output: refreshed roadmap; next decision checkpoint booked.? Optional (use if helpful)? Missed SLA threshold ? TAM · Due: 5 days · Play: root-cause + client comms.? Stakeholder change ? CSM · Due: 10 days · Play: new exec intro + value recap.Review trigger effectiveness monthly in the Portfolio review; tune thresholds or plays based on completion rates and rebound.Track First-Action SLA and completion by owner; keep Service Quality as TAM input, not a separate Health dimension.Definition of doneTriggers are live; new CTAs appear automatically with owners and due dates; completions are visible in the Monthly Portfolio dashboard; average time-to-first-action is under 72 hours. Step 6 — Lightweight OKRs (quarterly, outcome-based)Goal: Keep the team focused on outcomes that predict retention and progress.Owner: CS Lead (team OKR) + each role (role OKR)Timebox: 2 hours per quarter to set; 30 minutes monthly to scoreDo this? Set 1–3 Objectives per team/role; 2–4 Key Results each; score monthly.? Examples:? Team (Q): “Increase portfolio retention confidence.”? KR: QBR completion ≥95% in A, ≥90% in B/C? KR: +8-pt avg. Adoption/DMI gain in C accounts with open initiatives? vCIO (A/B): “Advance strategic outcomes.”? KR: ≥75% of approved roadmap items delivered on time? KR: Exec CX +5 points in A accounts? Add KR templates for A-segment exec attendance and decision latency to ensure governance enforces KPI gates.Definition of done? OKRs were published; green/yellow/red status was visible and discussed in the monthly portfolio review.Step 7 — Internal Meeting Rhythm (short, repeatable, proper)Goal: Clear blockers, prepare QBRs, and keep CTAs moving—without meeting bloat.Owner: CS LeadTimebox: Schedule once; run foreverDo this? Weekly AM/CSM (30 min): next 14 days of QBRs — agenda, assets, “ask,” follow-ups assigned.? Weekly CS Ops (20 min): data freshness, trigger audits, field corrections.? Monthly Segment Review (60 min): heatmap (Health, GRR/NRR, backlog); reassign owners; launch/close campaigns.? Quarterly Portfolio (90 min): OKR score, playbook updates, compensation calibration on agreed metrics.?

Credit-gate guide for live/digital QBRs (fields + ≤48h recap) and Stakeholder/Invite logic blocksThis gives you a lean but complete operating system that keeps roles coordinated, Health actionable, and QBRs decisive—built to fit MSPs with small CS teams and a mixed A–D client portfolio.
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?LevelGovernance Focus1.1 Technology SupportInformal, founder-driven oversight; minimal process or documentation.1.2 Technology EnablementBasic meeting tracking, health reviews, and SOP adherence begin.1.3 Technology ModernizationDefined CS roles and cadences; visibility into client progress and initiative backlog.1.4 Business TransformationGovernance frameworks include stakeholder mapping, risk tracking, and delivery scorecards.1.5 Business InnovationGovernance includes joint planning, OKR alignment, and executive-level steering committees.A-segment add-ons: enforce exec attendance ≥95% and decision latency ≤14 days as portfolio gates; show both on the Monthly Portfolio dashboard.How does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Client Business Goal – Governance evolves with client maturity. As goals shift from reactive IT to business innovation, oversight expands to include initiative ROI, department alignment, and cross-functional impact reviews.? 2. Customer Success Health – Governance provides the structure for regular Health Score reviews and interventions. Without this, risk signals may go unnoticed or unresolved.? 3. Customer Success Delivery – Supports consistency in deliverables (e.g., reports, strategy, budgets) through standardized approval, presentation, and review workflows.? 4. Customer Success Process – Governance ensures that meetings, assessments, and initiatives follow SOPs, cadence rules, and intake procedures. It’s the “managerial layer” that enforces process quality. 5. Customer Success Compensation – Governance enforces the credit-gate and KPI gates so compensation credit follows RACI owners and only counts evidence-backed outcomes (live or digital).? 6. Customer Success People – Clarifies leadership, decision-making rights, and escalation paths across CS roles (e.g., Account Manager, CS Manager, vCIO). Supports team performance management and internal communication.? 7. Customer Success Strategy – Strategy cannot scale without governance. This includes role-based scorecards, team capacity models, and alignment with segmentation, service levels, and playbooks. Use the Segmentation Playbooks Worksheet and Client Segmentation (Appetite ? Maturity) to drive which governance gates apply by tier.Product Links / Tooling SupportNot currently available in LMx. Governance support may emerge through future features, such as CS playbook adherence tracking, team dashboards, approval workflows, or role-based delivery accountability.Future module wishlist: auto-tracking of exec attendance/decision latency; alias-aware NRR/GRR widgets; digital-QBR credit-gate prompts.

OverviewWhat is the objective?Build a deliberate, segment-aware (A–D) relationship system where trust and “multi-threading” are managed—not left to chance. The objectives are to:? Ensure the right MSP role meets the right client stakeholder (TAM ? IT/Ops, CSM ? Ops/Admin/Team Leads, AM ? Budget Holder/Owner/CFO, vCIO/vCxO ? CEO/CFO).? Run a predictable touch rhythm (digital + live) matched to segment cadence and budget.? Measure relationship health (Engagement/CX, decision latency, execution follow-through, executive participation).? Make sponsor/contact changes low-risk (named backups, handover plays).? Tie all of this directly to the NRR/NDR and GRR/GDR north stars via the Growth Loop: Discover ? Align ? Deliver ? Measure.Why is it important?Even great strategy stalls without strong, multi-threaded relationships. A role-matched, repeatable relationship system:? Accelerates approvals and budget decisions (clear asks, the right people in the room).? Reduces escalation time and surprise risk through steady, relevant communication.? Survives personnel changes (executive sponsor or admin turnover).? Makes value visible at business, finance, and IT levels—lifting renewals and right-sized expansion (GRR/NRR).As an MSP, why do I need to do this?Because a small team must deliver a “big-company” experience consistently:? Role–stakeholder fit from 5.1: CSM is Accountable for relationship rhythm & Health; AM is Accountable for commercial; vCIO holds executive alignment; TAM anchors service quality and adoption inputs.? Touch mix by segment: executive pre-briefs and Executive QBRs in A; cadence-driven QBRs in B/C; digital quarterly touch + Service Reviews in C/D.? Ready-to-run relationship playbooks: new-sponsor onboarding, “we own the miss” recovery, decision-reset, and celebration/recognition.? Stakeholder map + preference card in PSA/CRM/CS: role, influence, decision rights, channel, frequency, backups.? Measurement that matters: Engagement/CX, decision latency, executive-attendance rate (A), recap ≤48h and follow-through ≤72h; Service Quality is a TAM-owned input that feeds Adoption/Alignment (not a separate Health dimension), reviewed in Service Reviews and surfaced in QBRs.? Tight alignment with 5.2 Enablement (kits, JSP-Lite), 5.4 Governance (RACI, triggers, cadence), and 5.3 Compensation (clear owners tied to outcomes).What is the Customer impact?For customers, the relationship feels:? Human and predictable (we show up with purpose, not at random).? Relevant (operational conversations with IT/Ops; outcome and value with executives).? Efficient (few but focused touches; 1–2 decisions per QBR; recap within 48 hours).? Resilient (if one contact steps out, the named backup already has context).? Transparent (a shared, easy-to-follow Joint Success Plan – Lite with owners and dates).Net effect: faster progress, fewer misunderstandings, higher trust—reflected in stronger renewals and expansion (GRR/NRR).
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Map Role ? Stakeholder by Segment (A–D) and make multithreading the defaultWhy it mattersWrong audience = no decision. One-contact risk = churn risk. Multithreading stabilizes engagement and speeds approvals.How to apply (use 5.1 RACI + your stakeholder map):? TAM ? IT/Ops (Service Review, lifecycle/adoption inputs).? CSM ? Ops/Admin/Team Leads (QBR cadence, decisions, follow-through).? AM ? Budget holder/Owner/Procurement (renewal, pricing, terms).? vCIO/vCxO ? CEO/CFO/MD (strategy, OKRs, prioritization).? vCISO ? Risk/Compliance, vCTO ? Tech-savvy exec/Architect (A, sometimes B).? Minimum 3 active threads per account (Ops, Finance/Owner, IT). Keep them current in the one-page stakeholder map (name, role, influence, channel, cadence, backup).Practical exampleSegment C QBR invite list template: CSM (Accountable), TAM (Consulted – lifecycle), Ops Lead (decision-maker), AM (commercial context, 1 slide).MeasureMultithread depth (# stakeholders/account), Executive Attendance Rate (A), “Right-person-in-room” %, Stakeholder map freshness.PitfallsToo many attendees; vCIO showing up in C/D by habit; stakeholder map not updated after staff changes.Concept # 2: Relationship rhythm by segment, with digital touches for C/D (format can flex; RACI cannot)Why it mattersConsistent rhythm builds trust and keeps decisions flowing without burning senior capacity.How to apply (align with 5.1 & 5.2 cadences):? A: Annual Strategy + 1–3 Exec QBRs (budget permitting). vCIO Accountable, CSM Responsible.? B/C: Annual Strategy + 1–3 QBRs. CSM Accountable (B: vCIO consulted; C: TAM consulted).? D: Annual IT Strategy + monthly/quarterly Service Reviews. TAM Accountable.? For C/D, add digital touch each quarter: email + 3-min screen-recorded video + “book-a-slot” link + SLA/DMI snapshot.? You may shorten formats when budgets are tight, but keep the same Accountable/Backup (RACI does not change with format).Practical exampleD-cohort (15 accounts) quarterly batch video: personalize first line + one next ask, attach SLA trend & lifecycle EOL list, embed booking link.MeasureTouch compliance %, QBR completion %, open/click/book rates (C/D), decisions/QBR.Pitfalls “Update” meetings with no decision; dropping the named owner when switching to digital.Concept #3: Make Decision Velocity the primary relationship KPI (use JSP-Lite + QBR “credit gate”)Why it mattersSlides don’t renew; decisions do. Fast approvals compress value realization and expansion timelines.How to apply (use the 3-slide kit from 5.2):1. Health snapshot (CX, Engagement, Adoption/DMI, Service Quality, Alignment).2. Roadmap/Initiatives (progress, blockers, new asks).3. Decisions & Next Steps — max 2, each with owner/date/budget.? Keep a one-page JSP-Lite as the single source of truth.? Apply the QBR credit gate from 5.4: expansion counts only if the decision is captured with owner/date/budget.Practical exampleSegment B QBR: CSM opens with Health & status ? vCIO sequences roadmap and ties to business outcomes ? 2 approvals landed ? recap ≤48h, tasks ≤72h, next decision date booked.MeasureDecision Latency (days/approval), Approvals per QBR, Recap ≤48h %, Next decision date set %.PitfallsNo decision request; missing owner/date/budget; recap not sent within 48h.Concept #4: Turn Health dips into automated relationship plays (alerts create tasks with owners & due dates)Why it mattersDashboards don’t fix risk—plays do. Automation keeps actions fast and consistent.How to apply (wire the four standard triggers from 5.4):? Engagement down (missed 2 touchpoints / no decision in 30 days) ? Owner: CSM · Due: 72h Play: 2-line recap ? propose 30-min reset ? add exec if missing ? update JSP-Lite.? CX down (negative pulse/complaint) ? Owner: CSM · Due: 48h Play: “we own the miss” call ? 3-point fix plan ? 14-day check-in.? Adoption/DMI below threshold (e.g., MFA <60% or endpoint <80%) ? Owner: TAM · Due: 5d Play: 3-step remediation ? 15-min ops sync ? pre-approve 1 quick win before next QBR.? Alignment low (“roadmap not relevant”) ? Owner: vCIO · Due: 7d Play: 20-min goal check ? resequence/cut ? schedule decision checkpoint.? Optional: Missed SLA threshold (TAM, 5d), Stakeholder change (CSM, 10d).Practical exampleC account Adoption –15%: TAM runs remediation; CSM owns 60-day follow-through with weekly 15-min sync until back to baseline.MeasureTime-to-first-action (<72h), rebound by next cadence, closed plays count.PitfallsAssigning to “the team,” vague due dates, too many rules launched at once.Concept #5: Persona-based messaging with pre-/post-comms templates (short, decisive, repeatable)Why it mattersRight message to the right persona reduces meeting time and increases approvals.How to apply (store in 5.2 Live-of-Work packs):? Talk tracks (2–3 prompts/role)? vCIO: value vs OKR, trade-offs, sequencing.? CSM: decision today, owners/dates, cadence/reset.? TAM: risk, lifecycle hygiene, adoption next step.? AM: renewal horizon, terms impact, budget window.? Templates? Pre-read (72–48h): subject, 3 bullets (last outcomes; today’s 1–2 proposed approvals; what happens next), deck link.? Recap (≤48h): summary, decisions (owner/date/budget), CTAs (≤72h in system), next meeting date.? “Approve by reply” snippet for C/D quick wins.Practical exampleA Exec QBR pre-read:1. Two outcomes since last exec session,2. Two proposed approvals (with budget ranges),3. Next milestone if approved.MeasurePre-read open rate, Recap ≤48h %, “approve by reply” conversions (C/D).PitfallsTech jargon for execs; newsletter-style updates with no ask; recaps that restate slides but miss owners/dates.Concept #6: Named Backup & continuity for every relationship (OOO, turnover, sponsor change)Why it mattersPeople move. Continuity preserves momentum and confidence.How to apply (bake into 5.1/5.4):? Name a Backup per account on the RACI sheet; show it on every agenda.? OOO handoff: calendar note + who covers which thread (IT/Ops, Finance/Owner, Exec).? Stakeholder change trigger (from 5.4): CSM · Due 10 days ? intro to new sponsor, 1-page value recap, confirm decision rights.Practical exampleAM leaves: within 24h send “Meet your team” intro (vCIO/CSM/TAM), book a 30-min relationship reset within 7 days, confirm the renewal window.MeasureHandoff time (trigger ? intro), “New Sponsor Onboarded ≤10 days” %, open relationship risks.Pitfalls “Backup = the team,” no reset call, old narrative copy-pasted for a new sponsor.Concept #7: Build executive sponsorship in A/B (OKR-linked story, CFO in the room, two decisions max)Why it mattersExecutive attention is scarce. Tie technology to business outcomes or lose momentum.How to apply (align with 5.1, 5.2, 5.3):? vCIO leads the OKR-linked narrative; CSM captures two decisions, owners, and dates.? Always include CFO/Budget holder when funding is implied.? Annual Strategy + 1–3 Exec QBRs; keep the agenda “outcomes first.”Practical exampleA account OKR: “Reduce downtime 40%.”? vCIO: resequence roadmap (DR drill, hardening) with value math.? CSM: Decision #1 approve DR test, Decision #2 adopt MFA policy; book checkpoint.? AM: note renewal timing; align pricing window.MeasureExecutive Attendance Rate, OKR-linked decisions count, time-to-budget checkpoint, Alignment colour trend.PitfallsvCIO sliding into sales mode (conflicts with 5.3), >2 decisions per exec session, skipping CFO when budget is needed.
Implementation ProcessStep 1 — Stakeholder Map & RACI-sync (per account, one page)Goal: Make multithreading explicit and name the Accountable/Backup for the relationship.Owner: CSM (inputs from TAM, AM, vCIO)Inputs: 5.1 RACI-by-segment, Client Segmentation Worksheet (A–D), CS Function Role Mapping, CRM contactsAction:? Build a one-pager: Name · Role · Influence (D/M/I) · Channel · Cadence · Backup.? Maintain ≥3 active threads per customer (IT/Ops, Budget/Owner, Executive).? Pair decision-makers to the right MSP role (TAM?IT, CSM?Ops, AM?Budget holder, vCIO?CEO/CFO).? Mirror 5.1 RACI (Accountable + Named Backup) and sync to CRM.Acceptance / DoD: One page per account shows ≥3 threads, decision-maker(s), named Backup, last-updated date.Output: “Stakeholder Map v1” stored in the account workspace and linked from agendas.Step 2 — Relationship Cadence & Meeting Mix (A–D)Goal: A predictable rhythm matched to segment and 5.1/5.2.Owner: CSM (calendar & invites). Support: TAM (C/D), vCIO (A/B)Inputs: Segmentation Worksheet, 5.2 meeting kits & templatesAction:? A: Annual Strategy + 1–3 Executive QBRs (budget-dependent) — vCIO Accountable, CSM Responsible.? B/C: Annual Strategy + 1–3 QBRs — CSM Accountable (B: vCIO consulted; C: TAM consulted).? D: Annual IT Strategy + monthly/quarterly Service Reviews — TAM Accountable.? Switch on digital touch for C/D (quarterly email + 3-min screen-recorded video + book-a-slot link + SLA/DMI snapshot).? Format can shorten; Accountable/Backup never changes (RACI stays fixed).Acceptance / DoD: Two quarters scheduled in calendar; QBR/Review templates attached; 48–72h pre-flight check confirms decision-maker attendance.Output: Segment-specific calendar + invite lists.Step 3 — Persona-based Templates (pre-read, 3 slides, recap)Goal: Short, decision-led messages per stakeholder persona.Owner: CSM (template steward: A/B = vCIO; C = CSM; D = TAM)Inputs: 5.2 QBR Kit + JSP-Lite, talk tracks, checklistsAction:? Use the 3-slide deck for all meetings: Health ? Roadmap ? Decisions (max 2; owner/date/budget).? Ship Pre-read (72–48h) and Recap ≤48h templates by segment/persona.? Add “Approve by reply” snippet for C/D quick-wins.? Pin all templates in the PSA/CRM account (≤2 clicks).Acceptance / DoD: Prep ≤60 minutes; every session has a pre-read & recap; JSP-Lite updated.Output: Linked template pack across all accounts.Step 4 — Health ? Relationship Plays Automation (CTAs with owners & due dates)Goal: Turn risk signals into fast action, not debate.Owner: CS Ops-Lite / CSM (rules). Execution: CSM/TAM/vCIOInputs: 5.4 trigger list, Health model (CX, Engagement, Adoption/DMI, Service Quality as TAM input feeding Adoption/Alignment, Alignment)Action (4 mandatory, 2 optional):? Engagement down ? CSM, 72h: 2-line recap ? 30-min reset ? add the exec ? update JSP-Lite.? CX down ? CSM, 48h: “we own the miss” call ? 3-point fix plan ? 14-day check-in.? Adoption/DMI low ? TAM, 5 days: 3-step remediation ? 15-min ops sync ? pre-approve one quick win.? Alignment low ? vCIO, 7 days: 20-min goal check ? re-map to business goals ? resequence/cut.? Optional: Missed SLA (TAM, 5 days) · Stakeholder change (CSM, 10 days).Acceptance / DoD: CTAs auto-created with named owner + due; time-to-first-action <72h.Output: Live trigger table + monthly rebound report.Step 5 — Decision Velocity & QBR “Credit Gate”Goal: Increase decision speed; only credit approved, evidenced decisions.Owner: CSM (JSP-Lite), vCIO (A/B storyline), AM (commercial notes)Inputs: 5.2 JSP-Lite, 5.4 credit-gate note block, KPI sheetAction:? End each session with ≤2 approvals ? log owner/date/budget ? update JSP-Lite.? Track Decision Latency (days per approval) and set the next decision date.? Count expansion (NRR/NDR) only after the credit gate is satisfied.Acceptance / DoD: Approvals/QBR ≥1 (A/B target = 2); Recap ≤48h; CTAs created ≤72h.Output: Decision log + monthly Decision Velocity chart.Step 6 — Continuity: Named Backup, OOO, Sponsor-Change PlayGoal: Keep momentum during absences or stakeholder turnoverOwner: CSM (coordination). Support: People/CS LeadInputs: 5.1 RACI (Backup), Governance triggersAction:? Maintain a Named Backup on every account (visible on agenda cover).? OOO handoff: who covers each thread (IT/Ops, Budget/Owner, Exec).? Stakeholder-change trigger (CSM, 10 days): new sponsor intro, 1-page value recap, confirm decision rights.Acceptance / DoD: OOO/exit notice sent ≤24h; ≤10 days sponsor reset call held.Output: Handoff note + refreshed stakeholder map.Step 7 — Executive Sponsorship in A/B (OKR link, CFO present, ≤2 decisions)Goal: Win and keep executive focus.Owner: vCIO (storyline), CSM (cadence & decisions), AM (budget/renewal context)Inputs: A/B Roadmap & OKRs, QBR Kit, 5.3 compensation guardrailsAction:? A/B: vCIO runs the OKR-linked story; CFO/budget holder present whenever money is needed.? Send pre-read 72–48h; cap at two decisions; book the next decision checkpoint.? CSM logs decisions; AM flags renewal window.Acceptance / DoD: Executive Attendance Rate improves; every exec session lands 1–2 approvals.Output: OKR-linked decision list + budget checkpoint.Step 8 — Digital CS for C/D (cohort send, quick-win catalog)Goal: Protect margins while keeping rhythm and perceived value high.Owner: CSM (content), TAM (data), approver: CS LeadInputs: SLA/DMI reports, quick-win catalog, 5.2 digital kitAction:? Quarterly cohort video (3 minutes) + personalized first line + 1 next ask + book-a-slot link.? Attach SLA trend, lifecycle/EOL, and a 2-question micro-survey.? Pilot with 10–15 accounts; then scale.Acceptance / DoD: Open ≥60%, Book ≥10%, ≥1 quick-win approved per cohort.Output: Documented digital flow + results snapshot.Step 9 — Metrics, Reporting & Feedback (weekly/monthly)Goal: Shared reality and fast course-correction.Owner: CS Ops-Lite / CSM LeadInputs: KPI worksheet, 5.4 reporting rhythm, 5.3 guardrailsAction:? Weekly CS Ops (30 min): Top Health deltas, assign plays, confirm dues.? Monthly Portfolio (60 min): Approvals/QBR, Decision Latency, Executive Attendance, Multithread Depth (# active threads with decision rights), QBR completion, GRR/NRR trend.? Flag when Health guardrails trigger (e.g., Engagement Red 2+ months ? expansion from that account does not count toward NRR this quarter; credit returns when back to Yellow/Green and a QBR resets next steps).Acceptance / DoD: Dashboard live; the last 2 weeks show Health deltas ? CTAs with owners; numbers end arguments.Output: Monthly Relationship Scorecard (team + segment view).30–60–90 Day Rollout (for a 1–5 person CS team)? Days 0–30: Steps 1–3 live (stakeholder map, cadence, templates). Pilot 3 A/B accounts and 5 C/D accounts.? Days 31–60: Steps 4–6 live (triggers, credit gate, Backup/OOO). First digital cohort for C/D.? Days 61–90: Steps 7–9 fully adopted (exec sponsorship routine, monthly scorecard, guardrails in effect). Tune thresholds.

Client Business Goal – Relationship depth (threads, exec sponsorship) scales with maturity D?A, mirroring the segment cadence and ownership patterns used across CS People (5.1–5.4).? Customer Success Health – Engagement is the operative guardrail here (exec attendance, on-time cadence, recap ≤48h). Decision Latency and Multithread Depth are tracked alongside Health. Service Quality remains a TAM input that influences Adoption/Alignment.? Customer Success Delivery – Uses the standard 3-slide kit (Health ? Roadmap ? Decisions) and JSP-Lite to capture outcomes (decision + owner + date + budget). Persona-based pre-reads ensure the right ask for the right audience.? Customer Success Process – Follows Trigger ? Prep ? Lead ? Follow-Up with a visible RACI stamp (Accountable + Backup) on every agenda. Includes the 48–72h pre-flight check (rescope if the decision-maker is missing) and the credit gate (no owner/date/budget = no credit).? Customer Success People (5.1 Roles & Responsibilities) – Enforces the role?stakeholder pairing: TAM?IT/Ops, CSM?Ops/Admin, AM?Budget/Owner, vCIO/vCxO?Exec, vCISO?Risk/Compliance, vCTO?Architecture. Keeps AM = commercial, CSM = health/cadence, vCIO = strategy, TAM = quality/adoption input, with named Backups.

OverviewWhat is the objective?To define the key Customer Success roles within the MSP that support effective delivery, strategic alignment, and client satisfaction. As clients mature and their goals evolve, the MSP must adapt by assigning roles that match their complexity, expectations, and engagement model. Role clarity ensures that the right people engage with the right clients at the right time, with the right level of depth, and that relationship coverage is resilient rather than dependent on a single person.Why is it important?? Clear roles prevent overlap, gaps, and confusion among clients.? Role specialization enables the delivery of scalable, high-quality services.? Supports predictable engagement models across client segments.? Aligns CS efforts with business outcomes, not just technical support.? Ensures human capital is aligned with the MSP’s delivery maturity and customer expectations.? Reduces the risk of relationship loss when team members or client stakeholders change, through multi-threaded relationship mapping.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Improves internal coordination between CS, sales, and service teams.? Helps match talent to client maturity and segment needs.? Supports hiring and onboarding by defining expectations and scope.? Enables better prioritization and accountability within CS operations.? Guides staffing decisions and skill development based on assessment of the gaps between current roles and desired customer experience.? It provides a clear path for scaling from a small team where one person wears multiple hats to a mature, multi-role CS structure.What is the Customer impact?? Clients interact with clearly defined contacts (e.g., CSM, TAM, vCIO) for specific needs.? Builds trust through consistent, role-aligned engagement.? Reduces confusion over who to contact for what, especially as complexity increases.? Enables higher-quality conversations focused on outcomes rather than just issues.? Ensures there are always multiple contact points so that no single relationship break jeopardizes client trust.Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Overview of CS RolesEffective Customer Success (CS) is pivotal for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) aiming to align technology investments with client business outcomes. 1. Technical Account Manager (TAM)? Type: Tactical | Technology-focused? Core Responsibilities:? Ensuring operational stability, lifecycle management, and technology standards.? Proactive management of client technical infrastructure.? Required Skills? Technical proficiency in IT infrastructure and service delivery.? Strong organization and detail-oriented problem-solving skills.? Familiarity with industry-standard frameworks (e.g., ITIL, lifecycle management).? Job-To-Be-Done? Internal: Ensures operational consistency and technology quality, reducing client incidents.? Client: Provides reliability and proactive technical management, maintaining client confidence.?

Concept #2: Account Assignments: Building Durable, Multi-Threaded RelationshipsWhy This MattersMany MSPs unknowingly build fragile client relationships by relying too heavily on one person on either side. If a key employee at the MSP or the client leaves, the relationship can become unstable or even fall apart. Strong account assignment planning prevents this.To build resilient, scalable client relationships, MSPs must assign roles based on purpose, not personality. The goal is to create multiple connection points—so the relationship doesn’t depend on any single individual.How Small, Mid, and Large MSPs Handle Account AssignmentsIn small MSPs, one person often plays multiple roles—such as acting as the TAM, AM, and even vCIO. While this may be practical at first, it limits scalability and risks the relationship if that person leaves.Mid-sized MSPs begin to divide responsibilities. A TAM may handle technical alignment, while an AM manages the relationship. A shared vCIO may provide strategic guidance across several accounts. This starts to build the foundation for a multi-threaded model.Large MSPs can assign each client or segment dedicated TAMs, AMs, and vCIOs. Roles like vCISO or vCTO are introduced in more mature accounts to guide security or technology strategy. These MSPs are well-positioned to mirror their clients’ internal structures and maintain multiple relationships across levels.Aligning MSP Roles with Client StakeholdersEach MSP role should be intentionally connected to a specific type of client stakeholder:? TAMs typically connect with the client’s IT contact or operational lead. They ensure technical standards, system health, and issue resolution.? AMs engage with operations managers or general administrators. They handle renewals, feedback, and relationship quality.? vCIOs partner with senior business stakeholders like CEOs or CFOs to guide strategic planning and technology alignment.? vCISOs focus on compliance officers or executive leaders responsible for risk and data protection.? vCTOs are best paired with technically-minded executives or advisors to discuss future innovation and architectural planning.Every important client stakeholder should have someone at the MSP who “owns” that relationship and understands their perspective.How to Build Multi-Threaded Relationships1. Don’t Rely on One Person Avoid assigning only one MSP contact per client. Assign at least two team members—such as a TAM and an AM—to ensure coverage across both technical and business needs.2. Match Roles by Function, Not Just Familiarity Assign roles based on what the client stakeholder is responsible for. For example, a CFO doesn’t want to talk about backups—they want to hear about budget, risk, and business outcomes. That’s a conversation for a vCIO, not a TAM.3. Use the Right Level of Seniority Senior client stakeholders should speak with senior MSP roles. A CEO should meet with a vCIO, not a technician. This helps build credibility and trust.4. Track Who Knows Who Keep a record of all meaningful client contacts and the roles at your MSP that support them. This makes transitions easier if someone leaves and ensures you cover all strategic areas.5. Build in Redundancy Ask yourself: “If our AM left today, would we still know what’s happening in this account?” Proactively introduce backup team members in key meetings and cross-train them on the account context.With the right assignment strategy, MSPs create stronger, more resilient client relationships. You reduce the risk of disruption from staff changes, increase trust across multiple levels, and improve both service delivery and strategic alignment. This approach helps you move from being a helpful vendor to a trusted, long-term partner.
Concept #3: Roles Should Follow the Client, Not the Org ChartThe most common mistake MSPs make when defining Customer Success roles is building them around internal org charts instead of client needs. The best role design starts with the client experience: what kind of insight, ownership, and engagement does a client expect at this business goal level?A Segment C client (typically at Business Goal Level 2) may only require one consistent point of contact, generally focused on managing services and providing limited scoping or enablement. In contrast, a Segment A client (Business Goal Level 5) expects multi-stakeholder collaboration, strategic initiative co-planning, and long-term business alignment. That’s why role assignment should scale with segmentation—based on client maturity, strategic appetite, and Business Goal, not just revenue or team availability.This doesn’t always require hiring new people. In smaller MSPs, a single team member may wear multiple hats. What matters is that each segment receives the appropriate clarity of role and engagement rhythm, so expectations are met and trust can grow.Concept #4: Distinct Roles Create Scalable, High-Trust EngagementEach Customer Success role serves a unique function in translating MSP capability into client value. When roles are clearly defined and consistently assigned, the result is improved delivery and increased client trust. Common roles include:? TAM (Technical Alignment Manager): Ensures delivery quality and tech standardization. Anchored in operational excellence.? AM / CSM (Account Manager / Customer Success): Owns health, roadmap coordination, and internal advocacy. Focused on value realization and risk mitigation. In small MSPs, one person often wears both hats—keep the RACI separate: commercial = AM (Accountable); health/cadence = CSM (Accountable).? vCIO / Strategic Advisor: Shapes multi-year planning, business alignment, and OKR-linked initiatives. Focused on long-term transformation.? Specialist Roles (e.g., vCISO, AI Consultant, BI Advisor): Deployed at higher levels to support niche business goals and innovation agendas.Each Customer Success deliverable—Reports, Proposals, Assessments, Roadmaps, Budgets, Meetings—should have an assigned owner by segment. Role specialization ensures that deliverables are executed and championed by the right person, at the right time, with the right intent.In all cases, keep AM and CSM roles distinct in the RACI: AM is Accountable for commercial/renewal outcomes, while CSM is Accountable for health and cadence management.Concept #5: Role Clarity Is the Foundation for Accountability and GrowthWithout clear roles, Customer Success turns into task triage. Who is responsible for follow-up from a roadmap meeting? Who confirms initiative approval? Who ensures the strategic story is carried through to the next QBR?Clear role design enables:? Defined ownership of each CS motion by segment? Internal accountability for performance and outcomes? Repeatable engagement patterns that clients learn to rely on? A foundation for CS compensation, progression, and performance metricsThis role structure not only organizes delivery but also unlocks career progression for CS staff. A TAM supporting Segment C clients may advance toward a vCIO role in Segment A accounts. That progression can be structured with maturity-aligned responsibilities, success metrics, and incentives, linking performance to customer impact.Concept #6: CS Health Reveals Role Misalignment—Or MasteryWhen Customer Success Health metrics dip—whether in Engagement, Technology Adoption, or Service Alignment—it’s often not a product problem. It’s a role misalignment problem.Clients in Segment A (high maturity, high appetite) expect strategic engagement. If they receive only basic technical coordination, you’ll see early warning signs in CS Health scores. Conversely, over-assigning complex roles to low-touch accounts can drain resources without benefit.Because CS Health is measurable and continuous, it becomes a real-time feedback loop for role design and development. It tells you:? Which roles are driving adoption and sentiment? Where clients feel unsupported or overwhelmed? Whether roles are producing business impact aligned with the Client Business GoalCS Health data closes the loop between role design and customer outcomes. If it’s not measured, rhythm breaks down, and segmentation slips.Health metrics (CX, Engagement, Adoption, Alignment) should be explicitly tied to role accountability in dashboards, so that dips always map back to a named role owner for review and correction.Concept #7: Roles Are the Starting Point for the Whole People DisciplineDefining roles isn’t just HR documentation—it’s the foundation for the rest of the People discipline:? 6.2 Responsibilities: clarify who does what for which segment.? 6.3 Enablement ensures that every role has the tools and guidance to deliver.? 6.4 Compensation ties measurable success to reward and progression.? 6.5 Governance tracks coverage, performance, and capacity across the CS team.When these are aligned, MSPs unlock scalable, resilient Customer Success capacity. When they’re missing or misaligned, performance stalls—even with great intentions.
Implementation ProcessDefining Roles for Scalable, Segment-Aware EngagementThe Roles Implementation Process ensures that MSPs define, assign, and operationalize Customer Success roles based on client maturity, appetite, and Business Goal level. This process creates the foundation for delivering consistent value, enabling strategic alignment, and tracking impact through role clarity and accountability.Step 1: Design Roles Based on Client Segments and Business GoalsStart by mapping roles to each client segment, using segmentation and Client Business Goal levels to calibrate role depth and complexity:SegmentGoal LevelPrimary Roles InvolvedPurposeA4-5vCxO, Strategic Advisor, SMEs (e.g., vCISO for risk/compliance; vCTO for architecture/innovation)Drive innovation, OKRs, and cross-departmental planningB3vCIO, CS ManagerEnable business alignment and initiative executionC2TAM, AM/CSMEnsure operational quality, stack alignment, and roadmap deliveryD1TAM, Owner/FounderMaintain service visibility, reinforce stabilityRole depth should scale by both strategic ambition and delivery needs—not simply by contract size. Smaller MSPs may assign multiple roles to a single person, but role functions must remain distinct and visible.Step 2: Assign Role Ownership for Key CS DeliverablesAlways name an Accountable role and a Backup for every deliverable. Clarify which roles are RACI owners (Accountable = single named owner) for each deliverable, and add a named Backup per account for continuity.? TAM/SDM ? Service Reviews (Lead), Health inputs, basic assessments (A/R).? AM/CSM ? QBR (Lead in B/C), Engagement tracking, initiative intake (A).? vCIO/Strategic Advisor ? Executive QBRs (Lead in A) and annual Strategy Planning (Lead A/B/C), budget framing (A).? Specialists/SMEs (vCISO, vCTO) ? consulted on security/architecture where relevant (C).Map each RACI owner to the matching client stakeholder (e.g., vCIO ? CEO/CFO; AM/CSM ? Ops/Admin; TAM ? IT lead).Create a role-to-segment engagement matrix. This becomes the foundation for planning team coverage, onboarding paths, and accountability during cadence-based execution. The deliverable owner should also be the relationship owner for the corresponding client stakeholder. For every deliverable and meeting, assign a RACI owner (Accountable) and a named Backup per account to guarantee continuity (no ‘the team’ owners).? Annual Strategy Planning (A/B/C) — Accountable: vCIO; Responsible: CSM (prep & follow-up); Consulted: AM; Informed: TAM.? Executive QBR (A) — Accountable: vCIO; Responsible: CSM; Consulted: AM; Informed: TAM/SMEs.? QBR (B/C) — Accountable: CSM; Consulted: AM; Informed: vCIO (B), TAM (C).? Service Review (C/D) — Accountable: TAM; Consulted: AM/CSM (if scope/cadence changes); Informed: vCIO (C).? Renewal & Pricing — Accountable: AM; Consulted: CSM; Informed: vCIO.? Health Dashboard & Alerts (CX/Engagement/Adoption/Alignment) — Accountable: CSM; Responsible (inputs): TAM; Informed: AM, vCIO.The deliverable owner is also the relationship owner for the matching client stakeholder.Step 3: Operationalize Roles Through Playbooks and Process AlignmentFor every meeting type, set Trigger ? Prep ? Lead ? Follow-up with a RACI owner and Backup:? Strategy Planning (annual, A/B/C): Lead = vCIO/Strategic Advisor; Backup = CSM.? Executive QBR (A): Lead = vCIO/Strategic Advisor; Backup = CSM. Target 3/yr if budget permits.? QBR (B/C): Lead = AM/CSM; Backup = vCIO. 1–3/yr depending on budget.? Service Review (C/D): Lead = TAM; Backup = AM/CSM. Monthly/quarterly or trigger-based.Ensure each role is embedded in process flows. ? Assign meeting ownership by segment and type (e.g., vCIO ? Strategy Meeting; TAM ? Service Review)? Define initiative lead role per segment (e.g., CSM for C-level clients; TAM for D-level)? Link roles to reporting: who presents which reports, and to whom?? Align intake responsibilities: Discovery and Assessment prep should have named role owners.This alignment reduces confusion, increases consistency, and ensures roles are actioned—not just labelled.Step 4: Use CS Health as a Feedback Loop to Optimize Role CoverageTrack Engagement, CX, and Alignment scores to detect whether roles are misaligned with client expectations. Examples:? Low CX in Segment A ? Possibly lacking strategic facilitation (assign or improve vCxO coverage)? Low Adoption in Segment C ? Potential misfit between TAM and roadmap follow-through? Missed Initiatives or Roadmaps ? Likely absence of CSM ownership or cadence planningCreate internal Health + Role dashboards to monitor which roles produce results and where refinement or support is needed.Step 5: Review Roles Quarterly and Scale with Client & Team MaturityAs clients mature, their role expectations shift. Conduct quarterly role reviews across the CS portfolio:? Promote TAM ? AM/CSM ? Strategic Advisor as engagement complexity rises? Reassign clients based on role bandwidth, Health data, or Business Goal level changes? Use playbook coverage and deliverable execution to identify team gaps? Tie role progression to enablement and compensation plans (see 5.3 and 5.4)Establish recurring CS leadership checkpoints to review each role category's segment-role alignment, escalation patterns, and staffing capacity.Final Output: A Role-Aligned Customer Success SystemWhen implemented correctly, the MSP will have:? Clear role definitions calibrated to client segments and goal levels? Assigned ownership of all strategic and operational CS deliverables? Embedded roles across the CS lifecycle (Discovery, Roadmap, Meeting, Budget)? Measurable accountability tied to Customer Success Health? A scalable role system that evolves with both the team and the client baseThis implementation process ensures that CS roles become levers of trust, execution, and strategic growth—not bottlenecks of confusion or burnout.

Client Business Goal – Role specialization evolves with client maturity and appetite. Higher levels require strategic, consultative roles, while foundational levels may only require reactive technical support.2. Customer Success Health – CX, Engagement, and Service Level metrics inform whether current roles are sufficient or need adjustment. Role depth influences perception, participation, and satisfaction.3. Customer Success Delivery – Certain deliverables (e.g., Strategy, Roadmap) require specific roles, such as vCIO or Strategic Advisor, to be effective. Role ownership helps ensure deliverables are understood and actionable.4. Customer Success Process – Roles must be aligned with intake, meeting, and initiative workflows. Poor alignment can lead to dropped handoffs or unclear ownership of customer service activities.7. Customer Success Strategy – Segmentation and SOPs dictate role engagement by client tier. Strategy must account for role bandwidth, specialization, and scalability across segments.Product Links / Tooling SupportNot currently tied to a specific LMx product feature.

OverviewWhat is the objective?Define clear, segment-aware (A–D) responsibilities for each CS role (TAM, AM/CSM, vCIO/vCTO, vCISO), directly tied to core CS deliverables (Reports, Assessments, Roadmaps, Budgets, Meetings). Use a simple RACI-by-segment one-pager per account to make ownership explicit (with a named Backup for continuity) and map each responsibility to the right client stakeholder.Why is it important?? Removes overlap and gaps by naming one Accountable owner per deliverable/process.? Prevents dropped handoffs; speeds decisions and follow-ups.? Makes Health signals actionable at the role level (who fixes what).? Scales cleanly with MSP size without changing the logic.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Build a Responsibility Matrix (RACI) per segment (A–D): role ? deliverable ? client stakeholder ? RACI + Backup.? Tie responsibilities to concrete process points (who triggers, preps, leads, follows up).? Keep AM vs CSM distinct in RACI (even if one person wears both hats):? Commercial (renewal/pricing/proposals) = AM (Accountable)? Health/Cadence (CX, Engagement, Adoption, Alignment) = CSM (Accountable)? Define a progression path (TAM ? CSM/AM ? Advisor ? vCxO) linked to responsibility depth.What is the Customer impact?? Right-level conversations (CEO/CFO ? vCIO; IT lead ? TAM), faster decisions, resilient coverage (Backup), predictable cadence and follow-through ? higher trust..Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Segment-Aware “Responsibility Packs” per Role (A–D)One-size-fits-all role definitions create ambiguity, missed handoffs, and wasted senior time on tactical work. Pack responsibilities by role and segment (4–6 outcome responsibilities per role per segment) so ownership matches client readiness.? Segment D (Goal 1 – Technology Support): TAM/Owner ? SLA rhythm, lifecycle hygiene. Meeting focus: Service Reviews + Annual IT Strategy Meeting (D).? Segment C (Goal 2 – Technology Enablement): TAM + AM/CSM split: service alignment vs cadence/reporting & initiative intake. The meeting?? focus: Service reviews, QBR (C), and annual strategy planning (C).? Segment B (Goal 3 – Technology Modernization): vCIO + CSM ? roadmap, budget framing, initiative pacing. The meeting focus is QBR (B) and Annual Strategy Planning (B).? Segment A (Goals 4–5 – Business Transformation & Innovation): vCxO/Advisor anchors OKR-linked strategy; CSM runs executive cadence. The meeting focus is Executive QBR (A) (up to 3/yr if the budget allows it) + Annual Strategy Planning (A).Health focus by segment: D ? Service Quality + baseline Engagement; C ? Adoption + Engagement; B ? Service Level Alignment + Engagement + sustained Adoption; A ? exec-level CX + Alignment + transformation-grade Service Quality.Practical examples? C: TAM owns lifecycle assessment inputs + service alignment; CSM owns QBR (C) delivery and initiative intake.? B: vCIO owns roadmap + budget; CSM runs cadence and progress reporting..Concept #2: One Owner End-to-End (RACI Accountable) + Named BackupWhen “the team” supposedly owns a deliverable, handoffs get fuzzy, follow-ups slip, and meetings drift without decisions. Make ownership explicit by assigning one RACI Accountable per deliverable/process and one named Backup per account. The same person can wear multiple hats in a small MSP, but RACI must remain separate: AM = commercial Accountable, CSM = health/cadence Accountable.How to set it up? One Accountable, consistently: Exactly one named owner per deliverable or meeting type, per account.? Named Backup: Visible on agendas and in your CS tool//PSA/CRM so continuity is automatic (OOO, turnover, load).? RACI stamp on every agenda/template: Accountable | Responsible (prep/follow-up) | Consulted | Informed | Backup.? Follow-up SLAs: Summary within 48h, tasks in system within 72h, approvals chased within 7–10 days.? Cadence & format flex by budget: Keep the Accountable even if you switch from a full QBR to a shorter session or a “deck + 3-minute screen-recorded video + 30-min call.”Meeting ownership (names and cadence aligned to Roles)? Annual Strategy Planning (A/B/C)? Accountable: vCIO / Strategic Advisor? Responsible (prep & follow-up): CSM? Consulted: AM (commercial), TAM (technical risks)? Informed: SMEs as needed? Backup: CSM? Output: updated roadmap, OKR links, top 2–3 initiatives with dates/owners.? Executive QBR (A) — up to 3/year if budget permits? Accountable: vCIO / vCxO? Responsible: CSM? Consulted: AM, SMEs (security/architecture/etc.)? Informed: TAM? Backup: CSM? QBR (B/C) — 1–3/year based on budget? Accountable: CSM? Consulted: AM (renewal/terms), vCIO (B), TAM (C)? Informed: SMEs as needed? Backup: vCIO (B) or AM (C)? Service Review (C/D) — monthly/quarterly or trigger-based? Accountable: TAM? Consulted: AM/CSM (only if scope/cadence changes)? Informed: vCIO (C)? Backup: AM/CSMCommercial vs. health/cadence (RACI line you’ll keep everywhere)? Renewal & Pricing: Accountable AM, Consulted CSM, Informed vCIO.? Customer Health & Alerts (CX, Engagement, Adoption, Alignment): Accountable CSM, Responsible for inputs TAM, Informed AM, vCIO.Documentation you use? One-page RACI by segment (A–D) per account: list each deliverable with A/R/C/I + Backup.? The RACI field is in every agenda (top-right corner).? The decision log is linked to the roadmap/success plan (who decided, what, when, and next date).Practical examples (ready to copy)? Segment B QBR? RACI: Accountable CSM, Consulted vCIO & AM, Informed TAM, Backup vCIO.? Prep: CSM pulls Health & initiative status; vCIO adds roadmap context; AM tags renewal horizon.? Follow-up: CSM summary in 48h, 2 CTAs in LMx within 72h, next date booked.? Segment A Executive QBR? RACI: Accountable vCIO, Responsible CSM, Consulted AM + SMEs, Informed TAM, Backup CSM.? Output: two exec-level outcomes (e.g., OKR tie-in, cross-dept initiative), next decision date.? Segment C Service Review? RACI: Accountable TAM, Consulted CSM (if cadence/scope change), Informed AM, Backup CSM.? Output: lifecycle gaps + one small approval; CSM nudges adoption owners.Concept #3: Map Responsibilities to the Right Client StakeholdersApprovals stall when you talk to the wrong audience. Keep every conversation relevant—and faster—by pairing MSP roles to the matching client stakeholders and embedding that map into your responsibilities and meeting plans.The simple mapping (use this on your one-pager)? TAM ? IT Lead / Operations — service quality, SLA/lifecycle, adoption nudges.? CSM ? Ops / Admin / Team Leads — cadence, decisions, initiative follow-through, Health.? AM ? Budget Holder / Procurement / Owner-Manager — renewals, pricing, terms, upsell timing.? vCIO / vCxO ? CEO / MD / CFO — strategy, roadmap, OKRs, prioritization, value narrative.? vCISO ? Compliance / Risk / Exec Sponsor — risk posture, controls, audits.? vCTO ? Tech-savvy Exec / Architect — architecture, modernization, innovation.How to operationalize it? Stakeholder map in LMx/CRM (one page): names, roles, influence (D/M/I), preferred channel, cadence, backups.? Invite list by meeting archetype (baked into templates):? Annual Strategy Planning (A/B/C): CEO/CFO + vCIO (A), Ops + CSM included for follow-through.? Executive QBR (A): vCIO + CEO/CFO + CSM; AM only for commercial context.? QBR (B/C): CSM + Ops/Admin; add vCIO (B) for roadmap blocks; TAM (C) for lifecycle items.? Service Review (C/D): TAM + IT/Ops; CSM attends only if cadence/scope changes.? Pre-flight check (48–72h prior): confirm the decision-maker is present; otherwise rescope (shorter session + book a decision call with the right exec).? Aftercare: Decisions are logged to the success plan/roadmap, tasks are assigned to the people who are in the room, and renewal timing is noted for AM.Segment-aware meeting aim (who must be in the room)? A (4–5): Executive relevance is non-negotiable ? CEO/CFO + vCIO/vCxO in Executive QBRs; CSM ensures outcomes and next steps are locked.? B (3): Move decisions faster ? Ops + CSM for QBR; vCIO joins roadmap segments; invite budget holder when approvals are expected.? C (2): Keep it operational ? IT/Ops + TAM for Service Reviews; CSM handles cadence and captures initiative intake.? D (1): Keep it simple ? Owner/Manager + TAM annually; otherwise Service Reviews with IT/Ops.Templates that make this stick? Agenda header: “Stakeholders for this session (Name, Role, Why here, Decision right)”.? Slide 1: “What we need from you today” (approve X, choose Y, confirm date Z).? Email pre-read: 3 bullets (last outcomes, today’s decisions, what happens next).Practical examples (ready to copy)? B-segment Roadmap + Budget Checkpoint? Attendees: vCIO + CSM + Ops Lead + Budget Holder (Owner/CFO).? Flow: CSM (cadence & status) ? vCIO (sequence & value) ? Budget holder (approve 1–2 items).? Output: approvals captured; next decision date; renewal note to AM.? C-segment Quarterly Review (QBR)? Attendees: CSM + Ops/Admin, TAM for lifecycle portion.? Flow: CSM (Engagement & initiative status) ? TAM (adoption/lifecycle gaps) ? CSM (one small approval).? Output: one approved initiative; tasks in LMx; 90-day date booked.? A-segment Executive QBR? Attendees: vCIO / vCxO + CEO/CFO + CSM; AM consulted if commercial topics arise.? Flow: vCIO (value recap vs. OKRs) ? decisions (2 max) ? CSM (next steps, owners, dates).? Output: exec-level outcomes; risks noted for vCISO/vCTO if relevant; follow-through meetings set.? D-segment Annual IT Strategy? Attendees: Owner/Manager + TAM.? Flow: TAM (SLA/asset hygiene, 12-month priorities) ? pick one improvement ? agree on a simple date/budget.? Output: A single upgrade is scheduled; Service Reviews will handle the rest.Concept #4:  Responsibility = Process Ownership (Trigger ? Prep ? Lead ? Follow-Up)Fragmented task lists create invisible gaps. Make ownership visible and end-to-end for every CS motion using a simple arc: Trigger ? Prep ? Lead ? Follow-Up, with a single RACI Accountable and a named Backup per account. Stamp this at the top of every agenda/template so no one has to guess.Apply by meeting type (aligned to Roles & cadence):? Annual Strategy Planning (A/B/C)? Accountable: vCIO / Strategic Advisor? Responsible (prep & follow-up): CSM? Consulted: AM (commercial context), TAM (technical risks)? Backup: CSM? Outputs: Updated roadmap, OKRs link, and next 2–3 initiatives with dates.? Executive QBR (A) — up to 3/year if budget permits? Accountable: vCIO / vCxO? Responsible (prep & follow-up): CSM? Consulted: AM, SMEs (as needed)? Backup: CSM? Outputs: exec-level progress, decisions, approvals, and a refreshed success plan.? QBR (B/C) — 1–3/year based on budget? Accountable: CSM? Consulted: AM, vCIO (B), TAM? Informed: SMEs as needed.? Service Review (C/D) — monthly/quarterly or trigger-based? Accountable: TAM? Consulted: AM/CSM (only if scope/cadence changes)? Backup: AM/CSM? Outputs: SLA & lifecycle hygiene, risks, ticket trends, adoption nudges.Make it operational with lightweight guardrails:? Agenda header “RACI stamp” (Accountable | Backup | Consulted | Informed).? Follow-up SLA: summary in 48h, tasks in CS tool//PSA in 72h, approvals chased within 7–10 days.? Templates: every deck/report starts with “Owner (A), Backup, Next review date”.? Handoff notes: a one-page “decision log” linked to the roadmap/success plan.Practical examples (ready to copy):? Segment B QBR (CSM Accountable)? Trigger: QBR due in 30 days (auto-notice).? Prep: CSM pulls Health & initiative status; vCIO adds roadmap notes.? Lead: CSM runs the meeting; vCIO handles roadmap questions.? Follow-Up: CSM sends 48h summary, creates 2 CTAs, books next date.? Segment C Service Review (TAM Accountable)? Trigger: monthly SLA review.? Prep: TAM updates lifecycle gaps; CSM adds any engagement risks.? Lead: TAM walks tickets/SLA/adoption; asks for one small approval.? Follow-Up: TAM logs decisions; CSM nudges adoption task owners.Concept #5: Use Health to Tune Responsibilities (Measure ? Signal ? Adjust)When Health dips, don’t swap tools—retune RACI ownership. Treat CX, Engagement, Adoption, and Service Level Alignment as routing signals that decide who leads what for the next cycle.Simple playbook:1. Measure weekly (portfolio board) and before each meeting.2. Signal thresholds (example):? Engagement < target for two cycles ? CSM escalates cadence reset.? Adoption ? 10–20% in C ? TAM deep-dives assessments; CSM owns follow-up.? CX risk in A ? vCIO/vCxO must own the next Executive QBR agenda.3. Adjust ownership for one quarter, then revert or lock in.By segment—typical retunes:? A (4–5): Low CX or unclear exec value ? vCxO/vCIO leads next Executive QBR; CSM tightens pre-work & decision capture; AM consulted on commercial impacts only.? B (3): Slipping decision velocity ? CSM remains Accountable for cadence, vCIO co-leads roadmap block until two approvals land.? C (2): Adoption stalls ? CSM becomes Accountable for initiative follow-through for 60 days; TAM focuses on lifecycle inputs and risk notes.? D (1): SLA noise ? TAM is kept accountable; CSM joins only if scope/cadence needs to change.Lightweight governance:? Health + Role board (columns: Segment, Health signal, Who is Accountable now, When we revert).? Green target: 80% of accounts “on target” mid-year; review exceptions monthly.Practical examples (ready to copy):? A account, CX amber ? Next Executive QBR: Accountable vCIO, Responsible CSM; add “Value recap” slide, confirm two executive-level outcomes; CSM books a 30-min follow-through within 7 days.? C account, Adoption down 15% ? CSM Accountable for two initiatives; TAM updates DMI and provides config notes; weekly 15-min sync until back to baseline.? Any segment missed approvals twice ? CSM is accountable for resetting cadence (shorter QBR, clear CTAs); AM is consulted if renewal timing collides.Concept #6: Same Logic as You Grow (Small ? Mid ? Large MSP)Growth and budget shifts shouldn’t force a redesign. Keep the same responsibility logic and split it cleanly as your portfolio and CS budget evolve—precisely as defined in 5.1 Roles.Calibration rules (match Roles 1:1):? AM vs CSM stays separated in RACI even if one person covers both day-to-day.? Commercial (renewals, pricing, proposals) = AM Accountable? Health & Cadence (CX, Engagement, Adoption, Alignment) = CSM Accountable? Meeting mix by segment & budget? A: 1? Annual Strategy Planning + up to 3 Executive QBRs (budget-dependent).? B/C: 1? Annual Strategy Planning + 1–3 QBRs (budget-dependent).? D: 1? Annual IT Strategy Meeting + Service Reviews.? Specialists (vCISO, vCTO) join Segment A when justified by risk/innovation—not by habit.? If budget tightens: keep Accountables, downgrade format (e.g., QBR ? concise deck + 3-min screen-recorded video + 30-min call), but do not drop the owner.Quarterly RACI refresh (fast checklist):1. Per segment, verify each deliverable’s Accountable + Backup.2. Remove senior roles from C/D unless needed; add vCIO/vCxO to A if CX/Alignment lags.3. Confirm AM=commercial and CSM=health/cadence in all agendas and templates.4. Tie any changes to Enablement updates (talk tracks, checklists) and Compensation levers.Practical examples (ready to copy):? Budget cut in a B account ? Keep CSM Accountable for QBR; switch to shorter QBR cadence with one approval per cycle; vCIO consulted only for roadmap decisions.? C account grows into B ? Add Annual Strategy Planning (Accountable vCIO), keep CSM Accountable for QBRs; introduce one roadmap initiative per quarter.? A account adds security scope ? Invite vCISO as consulted to Executive QBR; vCIO remains Accountable; CSM owns follow-up and risk register updates.
Implementation ProcessOperationalizing Responsibilities for Scalable, Segment-Aligned CS ExecutionGoal: turn role definitions into clear, segment-aware ownership with smooth handoffs, the right people in the room, and Health-driven adjustments.Step 1: Build the one-page Responsibility Matrix (by segment A–D)Create a single page per segment that lists every recurring CS deliverable and its RACI per account, plus a named Backup.Deliverables to include? Annual Strategy Planning (A/B/C)? Executive QBR (A)? QBR (B/C)? Service Review (C/D)? Assessments / DMI inputs? Reports (creation & delivery)? Initiatives & Budget drafting? Health Dashboard & Alerts? Renewal & PricingRACI quick rules? Exactly one Accountable per item.? Always list a Backup (person, not “the team”).? Keep AM vs. CSM split even if one person holds both titles:? Commercial = AM (Accountable)? Health/Cadence = CSM (Accountable)Starter example (copy into your template)? Annual Strategy Planning (A/B/C) ? A: vCIO | R: CSM | C: AM | I: TAM | Backup: CSM? Executive QBR (A) ? A: vCIO | R: CSM | C: AM, SMEs | I: TAM | Backup: CSM? QBR (B/C) ? A: CSM | C: AM; vCIO (B), TAM (C) | I: SMEs | Backup: vCIO (B) / AM (C)? Service Review (C/D) ? A: TAM | C: AM/CSM (if scope/cadence changes) | I: vCIO (C) | Backup: CSM? Renewal & Pricing ? A: AM | C: CSM | I: vCIO | Backup: AM delegate? Health Dashboard & Alerts ? A: CSM | R (inputs): TAM | I: AM, vCIO | Backup: AMStep 2: Stamp RACI into every meeting and deliverable templateAdd a tiny RACI block to the top-right of agendas, notes, and report covers so ownership is visible in every interaction.Agenda header (paste this)? Accountable | Responsible | Consulted | Informed | Backup? Decisions needed today (max 2): …? Who decides: Name/Role? Follow-up SLA: Summary in 48h; CTAs in system in 72h; approvals chased within 7–10 daysDocumentation habit? Log decisions to the Success Plan/Roadmap (not just email).? Assign named owners + dates for each CTA in your CS tool//PSA/CRM.? Book the next date before the call ends.Step 3: Tie responsibilities to the right stakeholders and cadenceUse the role-to-stakeholder map and the segment cadence rules from Roles.Who talks to whom? TAM ? IT/Ops (service, lifecycle, adoption nudges)? CSM ? Ops/Admin/Team Leads (cadence, decisions, follow-through, Health)? AM ? Owner/Procurement/Budget holder (renewal, pricing, terms)? vCIO/vCxO ? CEO/CFO (strategy, OKRs, prioritization)? vCISO ? Compliance/Risk | vCTO ? Tech-savvy exec/architectCadence by segment (name meetings correctly)? A (4–5): Annual Strategy Planning + Executive QBR (up to 3/year if budget permits)? B/C (3 / 2): Annual Strategy Planning + QBR (1–3/year based on budget)? D (1): Annual IT Strategy only; use Service Reviews for operational rhythmPre-flight check (48–72h before)? Confirm decision-maker attendance; if missing, switch to a shorter update and book a decision call with the right exec.? Keep the invite list lean and role-matched.Step 4: Bake responsibilities into simple, repeatable playbooksTurn each deliverable into a 4-step mini-playbook with explicit ownership.Trigger ? Prep ? Lead ? Follow-up (examples)? QBR (B/C)? Trigger: CSM (Health window/cadence)? Prep: CSM (status & slides), vCIO (B roadmap), TAM (C lifecycle)? Lead: CSM (Accountable)? Follow-up: CSM (summary/CTAs), AM (commercial notes)? Executive QBR (A)? Trigger: CSM (exec cadence)? Prep: CSM (storyline & outcomes), vCIO (value/OKR link), AM (commercial horizon)? Lead: vCIO (Accountable)? Follow-up: CSM (actions/dates), AM (renewal timing), vCIO (risks to next Strategy checkpoint)? Service Review (C/D)? Trigger: TAM (SLA/lifecycle)? Prep: TAM (tickets, adoption, asset gaps)? Lead: TAM (Accountable)? Follow-up: TAM (technical CTAs), CSM (if cadence/scope changes)? Renewal & Pricing? Lead/Accountable: AM; Consulted: CSM; Informed: vCIOPut these 4-step strips on the agenda footer so no one wonders who does what next.Step 5: Use Customer Success Health to adjust ownership quicklyTreat Health as routing signals for responsibility fixes, not just reports.Fast adjustments? Low Engagement (any segment): CSM runs re-engagement play (short update + decision call) and keeps Accountable until green.? Low Adoption (C): Keep TAM responsible for assessment inputs, and make CSM accountable for follow-through (weekly nudges for 60 days).? Low CX (A): Add/strengthen vCIO/vCxO presence in the next Executive QBR; CSM keeps actions tight.? Missed initiatives (any): Reset cadence; CSM Accountable for follow-up SLA; escalate to vCIO if decisions slip >30 days.Simple dashboard? One sheet per segment: Owner | Backup | Last meeting | Next date | Health (CX/Eng/Adopt/Align) | Risks | Next action.? Review weekly inside the CS team; escalate exceptions in your internal governance huddle.Step 6: Quarterly review and scale without changing the logicEvery quarter, run a short Responsibilities Review to keep the system sharp:Checklist? Is Accountable still the proper role by segment? (Avoid senior over-servicing C/D)? Are Backups named and present in key calls?? Are AM (commercial) and CSM (health/cadence) still clearly split in RACI?? Are Strategy/QBR/Service Review counts aligned to budget and segment rules?? Do we need to introduce vCISO/vCTO in A accounts?? Any role progression we can unlock (TAM ? CSM ? Advisor)?Update the one-page matrices, agendas, and playbooks and keep going.“Done” looks like this? Every deliverable has one Accountable, a named Backup, and a visible RACI on the agenda.? Meeting names and cadences match the segment rules (Strategy Planning / Executive QBR / QBR / Service Review).? Stakeholder mapping ensures the right people are in the room, every time.? Follow-ups hit the 48h/72h/7–10d rhythm and live in the Success Plan/Roadmap.? Health triggers change responsibilities or add coverage—you can see that on a single sheet.
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?LevelKey Responsibilities by Role1.1 Technology SupportThe owner/technician handles all reactive support, ticket escalations, and basic client communication.1.2 Technology EnablementTAMs handle delivery coordination, basic onboarding, and hardware/software rollouts. SDM may oversee client SLAs.1.3 Technology ModernizationvCIOs lead strategic planning, AMs manage cadence and reporting, TAMs support initiative execution.1.4 Business TransformationStrategic Advisors lead planning, CS Managers coordinate initiatives, and vCISOs assess risk and compliance.1.5 Business InnovationvCxOs oversee innovation portfolios, SME partners deliver advanced insights, and cross-functional coordination is formalized.Goal Level / SegmentPrimary role ownersOwnership emphasisHealth emphasisTypical cadence (aligned to Roles)D (Goal 1 - Technology Support)TAM / OwnerSLA stability, lifecycle hygiene, and incident follow-throughService Quality, baseline EngagementAnnual IT Strategy; Service Reviews monthly/quarterly or trigger-basedC (Goal 2 -  Technology Enablement)TAM + AM/CSMAssessments input, service alignment, reports, and initiative intakeTechnology Adoption, EngagementAnnual Strategy Planning + QBR (1–3/yr based on budget); Service Reviews as neededB (Goal 3 - Technology Modernization)vCIO + CSMRoadmap, budget framing, initiative pacing, decision velocityService Level Alignment, Engagement, and Sustained AdoptionAnnual Strategy Planning + QBR (1–3/yr based on budget)A (Goals 4 - Business Transformation and 5 Business Innovation)vCxO/Strategic Advisor + CSMOKR linkage, executive cadence, cross-dept programsExec-level CX, Alignment, transformation-grade Service QualityAnnual Strategy Planning + Executive QBR (up to 3/yr if budget permits)How does it connect to the other parts?? 1. Client Business Goal – Responsibilities evolve as the client moves up in maturity and appetite. Tactical roles dominate early stages, while strategic, planning, and innovation responsibilities emerge at higher levels.? 2. Customer Success Health – Role responsibilities directly impact CS Health metrics: Account Managers (AMs) and Customer Success Managers (CSMs) influence Engagement and Customer Experience (CX); vCIOs drive Technology Adoption and Service Level Alignment; Technical Account Managers (TAMs) and Technical Specialists (Techs) affect Service Quality.? 3. Customer Success Delivery – Each deliverable (e.g., Budgets, Roadmaps, Proposals) requires clear ownership to ensure they are appropriately produced, presented, and followed up on.? 4. Customer Success Process – Responsibilities dictate who triggers, prepares, leads, and follows up in each SOP/playbook and ensure cadence adherence (Strategy Planning, Executive QBR/QBR, Service Review).? 5. Customer Success People – Responsibilities reflect the finalized Roles model and RACI usage. Keep AM and CSM distinct in RACI even if one person holds both titles (commercial = AM Accountable; health/cadence = CSM Accountable).? 7. Customer Success Strategy – Segmentation, SOPs, and capacity models require role-specific responsibilities to be well-defined. This allows the CS strategy to scale across segments without confusion or duplication.Product Links / Tooling SupportNone currently.

?? 6. CS Technology
6. CS Technology[11]Building a Unified, Automation-First Customer Success EngineCS Technology includes five key blueprints:6.1. Strategy6.2. Health6.3. Deliverables6.4. People6.5. ProcessIn SummaryBuilding a Unified, Automation-First Customer Success EngineCS Technology weaves seamlessly through the entire Customer Success system, ensuring that behind every data point, workflow, and human interaction lies a reliable, modular technology foundation. While CS Strategy defines the portfolio-level logic, CS Technology ensures that the the strategy operates in real-time, is fully automated, and is powered by AI.“Technology is the engine that transforms Customer Success strategy into a repeatable, scalable reality.”An advanced CS Technology stack enables MSPs to quickly and flexibly answer questions such as:? How do we ingest and consolidate customer data in real time?? Which AI models predict churn, recommend next-best actions, or generate deliverables?? How do we modularly select and integrate new playbook orchestration engines, analytics layers, or generative AI components?? How can we ensure that CSMs can focus on human-to-human interactions while the system handles all manual tasks behind the scenes?As a client moves from the “D segment” (low maturity, low appetite) to the “A segment” (high maturity, high appetite), CS Technology likewise evolves—from the simplest scripted automations to API-driven, AI-powered self-healing engines.Technology Maturity Evolves with Client MaturityAs clients progress through the Client Business Goal levels (Segment D ? Segment A), the CS Technology stack evolves accordingly:? Segment D (Goal 1): Script-based automations generate light-touch deliverables, simple discovery forms, and threshold-based alerts.? Segment C/B (Goals 2–3): ML models refine Health scores and automate mid-cycle segmentation, dynamic playbook execution, and initiative delivery. Event-based triggers activate specific deliverables, governance workflows, and stakeholder roles.? Segment A (Goals 4–5): Fully orchestrated AI-driven execution, including generative reports, adaptive cadence recalibration, strategic resource reallocation, and self-healing initiative loops—all triggered by real-time data conditions.
CS Technology includes five key blueprints:6.1. StrategyWhat it is:A product-agnostic, API-first architecture blueprint that defines how data ingestion (e.g., PSA, CRM, MRR feeds, RMM), centralized storage (data lake/warehouse), ML/AI inference (Segmentation, Engagement Strategy, CS Playbook), workflow orchestration, and dashboards interconnect. It establishes a modular foundation, allowing every new data source or AI model to plug in without requiring the rewriting of core logic. Once raw Health, Deliverables, People, and Process data are loaded into the data lake and consolidated, AI-powered engines automatically generate Segmentation recommendations, Engagement Strategy plans, and CS Playbook drafts in real-time.How it evolves: ? Monolithic Scripts ? Point-to-point ETL jobs and basic scripts.? Modular Microservices ? Separate ingestion service, feature store, model registry, and inference API, each exposing a standard REST or event-stream endpoint.? Plug-in Ecosystem ? Low-code/No-code orchestration, versioned AI microservices, and feature stores that can be swapped or retrained independently. The workflow engine then routes AI outputs to update downstream Health, Deliverables, People, and Process modules without manual intervention.Why it matters:? Scalability: Ensures rapid integration of new data sources or models without rewrites.? Flexibility: Supports rule-based and AI-driven segmentation across all segments.? Speed to Market: New engagement plans and playbooks auto-deploy on health changes.Business Goal connection:? Segment D (Goal 1): Basic ingestion pipelines stream raw Health data into the data lake, triggering light alerts.? Segment C/B (Goals 2–3): Composite scores drive dynamic playbooks and proposal logic.? Segment A (Goals 4–5): Real-time inference orchestrates multi-role, outcome-driven strategy.6.2. HealthWhat it is:An AI-powered framework that synthesizes usage metrics, support ticket trends, survey feedback (NPS/CSAT), financial signals, and telemetry into five sub-scores: CX, Technology Adoption, Engagement, Service Quality, and Service Level Alignment. These roll up into a composite CS Health Score that maps to the Client Business Goal quadrant.How it evolves:? Manual Dashboards ? CSMs manually pull usage dashboards and correlate support volumes in spreadsheets.? Rule-Based Alerts ? Static thresholds (e.g., “usage < 20%”) fire email alerts and tasks, and sub-scores are tracked separately.? ML-Driven Health ? Churn-predictor models and clustering algorithms dynamically update segment boundaries, refine sub-score weightings, and trigger context-aware alerts.? Automated Scheduling/Triggers ? When an anomaly or risk pattern is detected (e.g., “Engagement < 70%” or “Alignment < 75%”), the system automatically schedules the next appropriate touchpoint (e.g., adjusting the engagement cadence or queuing a follow-up task) rather than simply notifying the CSM.Why it matters:? Detects early risk signals before escalation.? Aligns engagement strategy to real-time client conditions.? Creates a transparent, composite maturity/appetite view. Business Goal connection:Segment D (Goal 1): Monitors basic CX/adoption/SLA signals.Segment C/B (Goals 2–3): ML detects mid-cycle engagement drops and quadrant shifts.Segment A (Goals 4–5): Triggers proactive executive playbook delivery based on CX or alignment fluctuations.Business Goal connection:? Segment D (Goal 1): Minimal Health metrics: basic usage thresholds, simple adoption checks, and standard quality signals. Alerts prompt the TAM to review or tweak light-touch playbooks (e.g., “Service Quality < 80% ? revisit incident-escalation workflow”).? Segment C (Goal 2) and Segment B (Goal 3): ML models continuously refine sub-scores and the composite Health Score. Mid-cycle anomaly detection (e.g., “Engagement < 70%” or “Adoption < 60%”) automatically triggers a playbook review, refreshing the QBR structure or deploying targeted in-app guidance. Alerts also flag quadrant shifts (e.g., moving from Goal 2 ? 3), updating segmentation and engagement cadence.? Segment A (Goals 4–5): Fully integrated triggers: if an at-risk pattern emerges (e.g., “CX dips < 90%” or “Alignment < 75%”), the system queues the strategic playbook for a senior CSM or vCIO and notifies stakeholders with AI-generated next steps. Quadrant shifts (e.g., from Goal 3 ? 4) immediately update the client’s segment and adjust future engagement strategy.By progressing from manual dashboards and static thresholds to ML-driven insights and automated scheduling/triggers, this Health blueprint enables MSPs to detect emerging risks in real-time, allocate resources more efficiently, and maintain a single, transparent source of truth for each client’s maturity and appetite.
6.3. DeliverablesWhat it is:A structured methodology for generating automated, trigger-based, and AI-enhanced outputs that reflect Customer Success execution. Deliverables are created from the MSP’s CRM, PSA, RMM, or other IT management tools, and transform raw, structured data (e.g., usage logs, support tickets, financial records) into clear, decision-ready artifacts:? Reports (Executive Overview, Technical Summary, CSM-Internal Decks)? Proposals (scope, pricing, architectural diagrams)? Budgets (1–2 year financial forecasts aligned to roadmap milestones)? Client Strategy Documents (integrated narrative of goals, risks, and action plans)? Roadmaps (Gantt charts, swimlane views, “what-if” scenario planning)How it evolves:? Manual Collation ? CSMs copy and paste charts and tables into PPT/Word.? Semi-Automated Templates ? ETL pipelines populate slide masters with data; CSMs still write narratives.? Trigger-Based Assembly ? Templates are automatically populated when events occur (e.g., QBR due, stakeholder change).? AI-Driven Generation ? Generative AI drafts narrative text (e.g., “Key Achievements,” “Next Steps”) and auto-creates slide decks, budgeting spreadsheets, and roadmap visuals.? Autonomous Distribution ? Deliverables are automatically versioned, logged, and shared live or digitally—based on predefined cadence or CS Process triggers.Why it matters:? Consistency & Branding: Every report and proposal follows the same brand template, eliminating formatting errors.? Speed & Responsiveness: Last-minute data updates instantly produce an updated deck without manual effort.? Data-Driven Storytelling: Deliverables reflect CS Health signals and support decisions with narrative, visual, and financial clarity.? Engagement Moment: Deliverables become structured touchpoints—presented live when possible, not just emailed outputs.Business Goal connection:? Segment D (Goal 1): Operational snapshots (e.g., “last month’s usage, open ticket count”).? Segment C (Goal 2) & Segment B (Goal 3): Executive-ready summaries with ROI modelling (e.g., “We saved €X by reducing support costs by Y%”).? Segment A (Goals 4–5): Full strategic assets: integrated narrative, multi-scenario budgeting, and high-level roadmap tied directly to business KPIs.6.4. PeopleWhat it is:An AI-driven “people wizard” that codifies all Customer Success roles—from Junior CSM and Econ Manager to Senior CSM, vCIO, vCISO—and automatically generates:? Role Descriptions & Responsibility Matrices (mapping skills and tasks to each role)? Enablement Content (email templates, slide decks, playbook snippets, case studies) tailored to each role’s skillset and the MSP’s service catalog? Compensation Proposals (salary ranges, bonus structures, incentives based on KPI targets, regional benchmarks, and internal policies)? Governance & Cadence Frameworks (meeting schedules, portfolio reviews, segment-reclassification routines, and centralized source-of-truth documents)? Health Role Mapping & Accountability Models (automatically assigns CS Health metrics—CX, Engagement, Adoption, Quality, Alignment—to appropriate roles based on client segment and CS motion stage)How it evolves:? Static Job Descriptions ? Manually maintained PDFs/Word docs with basic responsibilities.? Template-Driven Wizards ? Spreadsheet templates map skills to tasks, but updates require manual edits.? AI-Enhanced Dynamic Models ? Role profiles reside in JSON/YAML; AI continuously matches actual team skill sets to required responsibilities and flags missing roles (e.g., “No vCISO assigned for cybersecurity-heavy Segment A clients”).? Continuous Adaptive Enablement ? As new services or “high-touch/low-touch” segment definitions emerge, the system instantly regenerates role requirements and training assets.? Dynamic Health Escalation Rules ? Health Score signals (e.g., low Engagement or stalled Adoption) trigger auto-reassignment, additional role activation (e.g., vCIO re-entry), or Enablement workflows.Why it matters:? Clarity & Alignment: Every CSM and extended CS role knows precisely what they own, what they don’t, and how they should be compensated—and this evolves as the MSP’s service catalog or client mix changes.? Skill-Based Assignment: AI ensures that high-complexity tasks (e.g., designing an AI pilot) are assigned to senior staff, while routine tasks (e.g., scheduling or basic reporting) are assigned to junior or economic manager roles.? Faster Onboarding: New hires receive an AI-curated role profile, email templates, slide decks, and a personalized enablement curriculum tailored to their existing skill set and the MSP’s portfolio strategy.? Health-Driven Role Optimization: Role value is validated against CS Health impact—when CX drops, Engagement wanes, or Alignment fails, the system learns which roles performed well and which need realignment or support.Business Goal connection:? Segment D (Goal 1): Lean teams—junior CSMs handling standardized, low-touch engagements.? Segment C (Goal 2) & Segment B (Goal 3): Layered roles—Senior CSMs own mid-market playbooks; vCIO/vCISO provide specialized guidance.? Segment A (Goals 4–5): Full-stack teams—dedicated security specialists, data scientists, and enablement leads produce custom artifacts for high-touch, co-innovation clients.All Segments: Health Score signals (especially in Engagement and Adoption) serve as feedback loops, triggering training, role handoffs, or escalation pathways based on real-world performance trends.
6.5. ProcessWhat it is:A centralized rules engine and event-bus orchestration framework that codifies every CS process into reusable, versioned workflows:? Meeting Scheduling & Trigger Automation (pre-defined cadences vs. event-driven exceptions)? Discovery & Assessment Intake (AI-assisted, profile-specific questionnaires assembled using structured client data)? Meeting Conduct & Documentation (auto-generated agendas, initiative capture from meeting notes, real-time transcription, and sentiment analysis)? Initiative & Project Lifecycle Management (task generation, roadmap alignment, and AI-enhanced summary preparation)? Governance Cadence (trigger-based escalation rules and cadence tracking, including monthly CSM syncs, quarterly QBR prep, and annual portfolio reviews)How it evolves:? Manual Handoffs ? CSMs individually manage calendars, send discovery links, and manually track next steps.? Scripted Workflows ? Basic low-code tools (Zapier, Power Automate) handle email reminders and simple status changes.? Orchestrator + AI ? An event-driven orchestration engine uses structured inputs (e.g., CRM, PSA, RMM, or other IT management tools) to trigger the right CS processes—like Discovery or Assessment—based on timeline or KPI change.? Full-Stack Governance ? Governance execution is fully automated and auditable. AI-enhanced routines personalize execution logic and identify missed actions (e.g., unviewed reports, stale roadmaps).Why it matters:? Closed-Loop Execution: Every trigger—whether a calendar cadence or a usage anomaly—resolves into a scheduled meeting, a task assignment, or a remediation workflow. No open loops.? Scalability & Auditability: Every process step is defined as code, version-controlled, and auditable—crucial for compliance and quality assurance in fast-growing MSPs.? Personalized & Adaptive Execution: AI prepares Discovery and Assessment flows, extracts initiatives, and ensures the proper process happens at the right time, regardless of engagement level.Business Goal connection:? Segment D (Goal 1): Fixed cadences—monthly check-ins and simple discovery surveys.? Segment C (Goal 2) & Segment B (Goal 3): Hybrid orchestration—quarterly business reviews supplemented by event-triggered deep dives (e.g., security assessment if the “Cybersecurity” survey flags a high risk).? Segment A (Goals 4–5): Fully dynamic loops—continuous discovery, real-time meeting generation on any KPI threshold crossing, and self-healing playbooks that reassign tasks and adjust roadmaps instantly.In SummaryCS Technology is the backbone that turns a Customer Success strategy, processes, deliverables, people, and health monitoring into a coherent, automated, AI-driven machine. When implemented well, it ensures:? Every Data Source Flows Smoothly into a unified data lake, feeding real-time health scores, analytics, and AI models.? Every AI Model Is Easily Swappable (churn prediction, next-best action, generative narratives) without rewriting core workflows.? Every Deliverable (Report, Proposal, Budget, Strategy Document, Roadmap) Is Auto-Generated with the latest data and AI-generated narratives—freeing CSMs to customize and personalize.? Every Role and Responsibility Is Defined by skillset and seniority, with AI automatically matching tasks to the right people and flagging gaps.? Every process is code-powered (scheduling, discovery, assessment, and initiative lifecycle), versioned, monitored, and continuously optimized by AI.As clients progress from Segment D (Goal 1) through Segment C (Goal 2), Segment B (Goal 3), to Segment A (Goals 4–5), CS Technology ensures they seamlessly “level up” from simple scripts and static PDFs to real-time AI insights and autonomous remediation—without a single manual pivot. It is the discipline that ensures human-first interactions remain at the core, while automation and AI power the engine beneath.

OverviewWhat is the objective?The objective of the CS Technology Strategy is to operationalize every core pillar of the Customer Success Strategy—Segmentation, Engagement Strategy, Playbooks, Service Catalog, and Standardization—within a unified, data-driven, API-first architecture. This enables MSPs to deliver scalable, automated, consistent CS execution across the client base. The technology stack ensures that every decision—from segmentation to playbook delivery—is based on the same shared data layer, logic, and system. Hence, each client receives the experience best matched to their segment, business goals, and maturity.Every strategic output—segmentation, engagement plans, playbooks, service recommendations, and stack alignment metrics—is dynamically generated and benchmarked against an integrated Service Catalog and Stack Catalog. This ensures that every assessment, proposal, and roadmap is grounded in catalog-driven offerings and objective stack alignment. At the same time, segmentation, engagement, and playbook logic remain equally foundational to all CS workflows.Concretely, the system automatically generates:? Segmentation recommendations (using MRR plus Composite Health [Maturity/Appetite] scores),? Engagement Strategy plans (prescribing the frequency, format, and depth of touchpoints for each segment),? CS Playbook drafts (tailored workflow templates and trigger conditions for each client and scenario),? Service Catalog mapping and recommendations (ensuring that every segment, initiative, and proposal references a structured catalog of ongoing and project services—providing a “single source of truth” for what is delivered at each level),? Standardization and stack alignment metrics (tracking portfolio-wide compliance with defined technology and process standards and surfacing actionable gaps to drive roadmap and initiative planning).These outputs are continuously refreshed and drive the downstream modules of Customer Success Health, Delivery, People, and Process—ensuring that every client receives the right level of engagement and support, grounded in standardized operations and personalized business context.Why is it important?A unified, architecture-driven strategy ensures that all core Customer Success processes—client segmentation, engagement cadence, playbook execution, service catalog mapping, and standardization—are orchestrated from the same real-time data and logic. This eliminates silos, prevents duplication, and accelerates strategic decision-making across the entire client base.With this approach, segmentation is always up to date, engagement rhythms are automatically adjusted for each segment, playbooks are tailored and triggered based on real signals, service catalog options are proactively surfaced and recommended, and the standardization of technology and services ensures that execution is consistent and scalable. Only reduces the risk of over-serving low-potential clients or under-investing in high-value accounts and increases the quality, predictability, and business impact of every CS initiative.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?Without a technology-driven, blueprint-aligned CS strategy, MSPs are forced to manually segment clients, improvise engagement routines, build one-off playbooks, and create ad hoc proposals—leading to inefficiencies, errors, and inconsistent experiences. By adopting this system, you can:? Automatically segment and re-segment clients as their value, maturity, or goals change,? Deliver engagement strategies and playbooks that precisely fit each segment’s real needs and readiness,? Map proposals and initiatives directly to the exemplary service catalog items.? Enforce and benefit from a portfolio-wide standard technology stack and delivery model.This enables you to scale your CS operation, launch new services or playbooks quickly, reduce onboarding and training overhead, and ensure that every client interaction aligns with their business objectives and operational standards.What is the Customer impact?Clients experience a CS process that is transparent, personalized, and proactive:? They receive only the services, engagement rhythms, and playbook-driven support relevant to their segment, business goal, and maturity,? They can clearly see what is included in their service package and what opportunities exist for growth, thanks to a transparent service catalog,? They benefit from predictable quality, faster delivery, and fewer handoffs or errors due to a standardized technology stack and service approach,? They always have a clear path to improvement or innovation since every risk or opportunity is automatically mapped to a concrete initiative or catalog item and supported by tailored playbooks.This results in higher satisfaction, more productive business conversations, and a strengthened partnership between the client and MSP, driving retention and shared success..
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Continuous, AI-Driven SegmentationPractical Recommendation: Implement automated segmentation with an AI model that uses live data from your CS tool, CRM, PSA, and CS Health scoring. Ensure segmentation logic (both MRR banding and business goal scoring) is visible in a dashboard and auto-updates as clients move. Set up rules for any significant Health change (e.g., adoption drop or engagement boost) to trigger an immediate re-segmentation and workflow update.Tech Tip: Use your data lake to pull composite health scores and MRR, then automate segment assignments with scheduled or real-time jobs (e.g., a scheduled Python script, workflow automation tool, or a BI platform with custom logic). Integrate segment tags into every client record across all systems.Concept #2: Engagement Strategy as a System, Not a SchedulePractical Recommendation: Define engagement templates for each segment (frequency, meeting type, roles, prep steps). Build these into your workflow engine so that the engagement cadence and role assignment are automatically updated when a client moves the segment. Regularly check your CS team’s available hours against the planned engagement load—use this to inform hiring or to re-balance engagement levels.Tech Tip: Leverage your calendar API and workflow tool to auto-schedule recurring meetings for each client based on their segment. Build engagement capacity dashboards in your BI/reporting platform to visualize workload and spot imbalances.Concept #3: Playbooks Are Digital Workflows, Not PDFsPractical Recommendation: Document and digitalize your top CS playbooks for each segment and key lifecycle event (e.g., onboarding, roadmap review, QBR, health drop). Build playbook steps as checklists or tasks in your workflow engine so execution and completion can be monitored and reported. Trigger playbook assignment via automation, not just manual selection—e.g., missed engagement, low health score, or segment change.Tech Tip: Use a workflow automation platform (Zapier, Power Automate, or similar) or custom tool to create digital playbook templates. Ensure each playbook step is mapped to a CS tool, CRM or PSA activity and completion updates are tracked automatically. Build dashboards for playbook completion rates and bottlenecks.Concept #4: Service Catalog as a Recommendation EnginePractical Recommendation: Tag each service catalog item with the relevant segments and business goal levels (e.g., "Segment B / Goal 3: Cloud Migration Assessment"). Regularly review clients’ current services versus the catalog to highlight gaps and suggest initiatives or projects automatically. Build proposal templates that directly pull in catalog items and initiative scopes so sales and CS teams don’t have to reinvent proposals.Tech Tip: Use your BI/reporting or CRM platform to run catalog gap analysis—auto-generate "service opportunity" lists for each client. Integrate catalog items into your quoting and proposal tool (e.g., with a shared item library or API), so recommendations are embedded in every initiative.Concept #5: Standardization as an Enforceable MetricPractical Recommendation: Define your standard stack (by service category and vendor) and tag every client and service instance for compliance. Set up automated stack conformance checks—identify and flag deviations, then automatically suggest remediation playbooks (e.g., "Switch backup to standard platform," "Enable MFA"). Tie non-standard stack elements to health scoring so they impact CS metrics and trigger initiative planning. Build a stack compliance dashboard—use your RMM, PSA, or custom inventory tool to check deployed technologies against your standard list. Set up automated alerts for exceptions. Use these exceptions to trigger automated initiative or roadmap item creation in your CS/project management platform.Concept #6: Service Catalog as a Dynamic Source of TruthPractical Recommendation: Establish a centralized service catalog that is structured according to segment and business goal level. For every proposal, assessment, and QBR, compare actual client services to the catalog and use gap analysis to trigger new initiatives, project recommendations, or renewal proposals. Regularly update catalog items with feedback from playbook outcomes, client requests, and market changes.Tech Tip:Integrate the catalog with your proposal and roadmap tools using APIs or shared templates. Automate “catalog gap” detection and embed suggested upsell/cross-sell opportunities into your CS dashboard. Ensure all team members reference the catalog for every deliverable and playbook trigger.
Application ProcessStep 1: Map and Normalize All Client, Financial, and Service DataIntegrating all core systems—PSA, CRM, RMM, financial, calendar, and any legacy data sources—into a central, versioned data lake. Standardize all client identifiers, service records, contract values (MRR), health scores, playbook histories, and catalog adoption data. This unified, normalized foundation allows every other CS Strategy pillar (segmentation, engagement, playbooks, catalog, standardization) to use the same accurate information for both automation and reporting.Step 2: Segment Clients Using a Dual-Axis (Value & Readiness) ModelApply a two-level segmentation logic, as defined in the Segmentation blueprint:? Primary segmentation by Client Business Goal (using maturity and appetite scores calculated from CS Health and discovery data),? Secondary segmentation by financial value (MRR bands).Clients are automatically placed into the right segment (A–D) and band, which drives all downstream engagement, playbook, catalog, and standardization decisions. Segment assignments are continuously reviewed and updated as client health, engagement, or business goals evolve.Step 3: Define and Allocate Engagement Strategies by Segment and CapacityFor each client segment and MRR band, establish engagement cadence, interaction format, meeting types, and assigned roles (vCIO, CSM, TAM), following the Engagement Strategy blueprint.? Calculate and allocate CS team capacity based on real client distribution and internal resource availability,? Balance proactive (planned) vs. reactive (ad hoc) CS work for each segment,? Adjust engagement investment as needed to stay within operational limits and ensure strategic clients receive priority.These engagement plans are versioned, monitored, and dynamically adapted as health and segment data changes.Step 4: Deploy, Select, and Tailor Playbooks for Consistent ExecutionSelect and personalize CS playbooks for each client and segment, based on current engagement strategy, health triggers, and catalog usage, in line with the Playbooks blueprint:? Trigger playbooks automatically based on cadence, risk signals, or business milestones (e.g., roadmap review, health drop, assessment finding),? Assign the correct roles for delivery,? Monitor completion and outcome, feeding the results into the system for analysis and improvement.Playbook coverage is regularly reviewed to ensure up-to-date, repeatable workflows support every segment and service level.Step 5: Map and Recommend Service Catalog Items to Segments and InitiativesFor each client, map current services and identify gaps by referencing the Service Catalog:? Proactively recommend catalog items (ongoing or project-based) that align with the client’s business goals and segment readiness,? Integrate catalog options into all proposals, initiatives, and playbooks,? Track adoption, upsell/cross-sell, and renewal opportunities using catalog-linked dashboards. Catalog recommendations and usage patterns are reviewed regularly to surface service gaps, emerging needs, and opportunities for standardization.Each assessment, onboarding, or QBR automatically benchmarks the client’s actual and contracted services against the Service Catalog for their segment and maturity level. Detected gaps are converted into actionable project or proposal recommendations, ensuring every client engagement is catalog-driven. Service Catalog mapping also supports proactive playbook selection and ensures deliverables are consistent.Step 6: Monitor and Enforce Standardization Across the PortfolioAssess each client’s alignment to the standardized technology stack and service delivery model, as defined in the Standardization blueprint:? Flag non-standard configurations, technologies, or services,? Prioritize standardization initiatives based on risk, client maturity, and business opportunity,? Integrate standardization metrics into health scoring, roadmap planning, onboarding, and reporting. Use stack conformance data to drive ongoing improvement and future roadmap priorities.Use a living Stack Catalog (preferred tools, configurations, and standards) to benchmark every client environment for onboarding, QBRs, and roadmap planning. All non-standard items are flagged, and automated initiatives or playbooks are generated to close stack gaps. Stack alignment scores are integrated with health scoring and appear in dashboards and reporting.Step 7: Expose Real-Time Dashboards, Alerts, and InsightsProvide dedicated dashboards for every CS Strategy pillar:? Segmentation status and movements,? Engagement cadence and CS capacity utilization,? Playbook execution and completion,? Service catalog coverage and gaps,? Standardization compliance and exceptions.Set up automated alerts for key events—segment drift, engagement drops, missed playbooks, catalog gaps, or non-standard stack risks—so the CS team can act proactively.Step 8: Continuous Review, Feedback, and GovernanceOn a regular cadence (e.g., monthly/quarterly), review performance data, client feedback, health trends, and operational capacity:? Update segmentation logic and business goal mapping as new data emerges,? Refine engagement models and playbook workflows based on real outcomes,? Expand and evolve the service catalog and standard stack as market or technology shifts require,? Document and communicate all version changes through formal governance reviews, ensuring cross-functional buy-in and operational clarity.This cycle ensures the CS Technology Strategy is not static but a living system that continuously improves alignment between client needs, business strategy, and operational delivery.
AppendixHow does Strategy connect to Client Business Goal levels?Client Business Goal LevelCS Strategy FocusDownstream Impact1. Technology SupportThe strategy focuses on precise segmentation (Segment D) and minimal, cost-effective engagement cadence. The default is a “keep-the-lights-on” mode, prioritizing operational stability, basic visibility, and fast issue resolution, not strategic planning.All CS Health metrics and Processes are centred around SLA tracking, ticket response, and baseline service quality. Meeting rhythm is minimal (annual/ad hoc). Initiatives and Deliverables are basic, standardized reports and immediate problem-resolution actions.2. Technology EnablementStrategy introduces structure: for Segment C clients, quarterly QBRs, simple project/initiative-based roadmaps, and straightforward TAM/SDM role assignment become standard.CS Health places greater weight on technology adoption and engagement trends. The process includes routine discovery intake and assessments, which support client progression and maturity. Deliverables start to include project proposals and basic stack alignment reporting.3. Technology ModernizationStrategy enables roadmap-driven operation for Segment B clients: formal QBRs, dedicated AM/vCIO involvement, and all initiatives, assessments, and deliverables focused on modernization and lifecycle alignment.CS Health now evaluates all five dimensions (CX, Engagement, Adoption, Alignment, and Service Quality). The process shifts to quarterly or more frequent assessments and roadmap reviews. Deliverables cover detailed strategic documentation and complex initiatives.4. Business TransformationStrategy at this level aligns with Segment A clients’ business goals: annual strategic planning, quarterly reviews, monthly executive meetings, department-level alignment, cross-functional initiatives, all supported by vCIO/Strategic Advisor roles.CS Health incorporates business outcome indicators and stakeholder engagement. Process mandates Discovery + Assessment + Meeting + Initiative rhythm. Deliverables are outcome-oriented; People discipline drives cross-department communication and enablement.5. Business InnovationThe strategy supports co-innovation: clients actively participate in strategic, OKR-based planning, innovation programs, and advanced analytics/AI roadmaps. Segmentation and Engagement Strategies are dynamic, with multiple stakeholders and continuous steering.CS Health and Process now track multi-level, cross-department alignment, adoption, and engagement. Deliverables provide innovation roadmaps and advanced outcome reporting. People discipline includes vCxO, innovation leads, and specialist teams with ongoing enablement and governance.How does Strategy connect to other CS disciplines?? Client Business Goal: Strategy is fundamentally anchored in the Client Business Goal framework—every aspect of segmentation, engagement, playbook logic, and service catalog mapping is driven by the client’s maturity and appetite. Strategic planning is reviewed annually to align with evolving business goals and segment changes.? CS Strategy: The 6.1 Strategy blueprint operationalizes all five pillars: dynamic segmentation, targeted engagement strategy, standardized playbooks, catalog-driven initiative planning, and enforceable standardization. Every strategic workflow begins and ends with this unified logic.? CS Health: Strategy and Health are tightly integrated: segmentation changes, subscore movements, or drops in engagement can trigger an immediate strategic response (e.g., new playbook, cadence change, or initiative). Health metrics provide continuous feedback loops for strategy refinement.? CS Deliverables: Strategy defines the deliverable standards for each segment, including what reports, roadmaps, budgets, and other outputs are required and how they are aligned to playbooks, meetings, initiatives, and roadmap milestones. Deliverables become more sophisticated as client business goals and segment levels advance.? CS Process: Strategy sets the process logic—every workflow (Discovery, Assessment, Meeting, Initiative) is triggered, prioritized, and executed based on the segmentation, engagement rhythm, and playbook standards defined at the strategy level. Process cadence and complexity always map to the client segment.? CS People: Strategy determines resource allocation, team enablement, governance, and role assignment. For Segment A/B clients, this means cross-functional, strategic teams; for C/D segments, more streamlined TAM/AM delivery. The strategy routinely reviews people allocation and competencies to ensure the team structure matches client needs and business goals.

Aspect: Engagement Strategy vs. CS PlaybookAppendixHow does it connect to Client Business Goal levels?How does it connect to the other disciplines?Product Links / Tooling Support
OverviewWhat is the objective?The CS Technology Health methodology defines a product-agnostic, API-first approach within the larger Customer Success ecosystem. In this model, an average mid-tier MSP managing 100 or more clients cannot rely on offline spreadsheets or manual reports to stay up-to-date. Instead, diverse data sources—such as PSA, CRM, MRR feeds, RMM, and other IT-management tools—stream raw information about Strategy, Deliverables, People, and Processes into a centralized data lake or warehouse. Once data is consolidated, AI-powered engines automatically compute a real-time composite Health Score by consolidating signals around client experience, technology adoption, engagement, service quality, and service level alignment. Those AI-generated Health outputs become the strategic instructions for downstream Strategy, Deliverables, People, and Process modules (e.g., triggering segmentation updates, playbook adjustments, or resource reallocation).Why is it important?? Health Score as the single source of truth: a continuously updated composite prevents reactive firefighting by surfacing risks early and revealing shifts in client appetite or maturity (quadrant changes).? Multi-dimensional insight: each sub-score (CX, adoption, engagement, quality, alignment) signals appetite (strategic intent) or maturity (operational stability), allowing MSPs to distinguish between technical/operational risks and strategic/business risks.? Alert-driven guidance: Rather than auto-scheduling fix-it meetings, Health generates intelligent alerts that guide stakeholders to review or adjust playbooks. Alerts also flag quadrant shifts, allowing segmentation and engagement strategies (handled by the Strategy module) to be updated accordingly.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?? Client Experience (CX) ? Appetite (Strategic) Signal: A decline in CX indicates eroding trust and strategic misalignment, with high impact on business outcomes.Technology Adoption ? Maturity (Operational) Signal: a drop in adoption highlights foundational or technical gaps—lower immediate business impact but high operational risk.? Engagement ? Appetite/Maturity Hybrid Signal: low engagement can signal either operational stagnation (low maturity) or strategic shift (high appetite) if executives disengage.? Service Quality ? Maturity (Operational) Signal: Poor service quality indicates inconsistent execution—high operational risk, lower direct strategic impact.? Service Level Alignment ? Hybrid, Leaning Strategic Signal: Misalignment indicates that delivered services no longer align with the client’s evolving business goals—high risk for churn or lost growth.What is the Customer impact?? Segment D (Goal 1): basic monitoring: simple CX checks, minimal adoption tracking, standard quality checks. Alerts direct the TAM to review light-touch playbooks (e.g., “Quality < 80% ? revisit incident-escalation playbook”).? Segment C (Goal 2): Rule-based and occasional ML anomaly detection. Alerts generate opportunities to refine quarterly playbooks (e.g., “Engagement < 70% ? adjust QBR structure”).? Segment B (Goal 3): biweekly/monthly ML-supported monitoring. Alerts route to senior CSM or vCIO to fine-tune strategic playbooks (e.g., “Alignment < 70% ? update roadmap playbook”).? Segment A (Goals 4–5): Continuous ML inference provides early warning of appetite or maturity shifts (quadrant changes). Alerts guide executive-level playbook tuning (e.g., “CX dips < 90% ? review executive engagement framework”) without auto-scheduling meetings.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Client Experience (CX) Is the First Appetite Signal (High Impact)? Definition: CX measures how the client perceives the overall service journey, encompassing communication clarity, responsiveness, meeting relevance, and trust. It directly reflects the client’s appetite: high CX means the client feels value and is primed for deeper engagement; low CX signals strategic misalignment.? How it works:? Surveys & Sentiment Analysis: After each meeting, a short CSAT/NPS survey is triggered via the CRM; recorded calls feed an NLP sentiment engine to identify positive and negative phrase frequencies.? Quadrant Insight:? Sustained CX decline reduces appetite, potentially shifting the client toward a lower quadrant of the market.? High CX in a mid-maturity client suggests readiness to move up (e.g., from Goal 3 to Goal 4)? Why it matters:CX is the earliest strategic signal. An alert on falling CX prompts review of engagement-style playbooks (e.g., “Revise QBR agenda,” “Adjust leadership participation”) rather than automatically scheduling a remedial call.Concept #2: Technology Adoption Is a Maturity Signal (Lower Business Impact)? Definition: Adoption measures real-world usage of MSP-recommended technologies; deployed solutions must be actively used. This is primarily an operational (maturity) signal—lower immediate business impact, but critical for long-term stability.? How it works: Category & Insight Definition: Break each primary technology domain (Security, Collaboration, Cloud, etc.) into weighted, measurable insights (e.g., “MFA enabled on 90% of users” = 10 points, “endpoint AV compliance” = 10 points). Compliance Calculation: For each insight:1. earned points = (actual % / target %) ? insight points2. Aggregate Score: Sum all earned points, divide by total possible points, normalize to 0–100. Segment Thresholds:? D (Goal 1): < 50 ? “At Risk”; 50–70 ? “Partial”; > 70 ? “Stable.”? C (Goal 2): < 60 ? “At Risk”; 60–80 ? “Partial”; > 80 ? “Stable.”? B (Goal 3): < 70 ? “At Risk”; 70–90 ? “Partial”; > 90 ? “Stable.”? A (Goals 4–5): < 90 ? “Watch”; ≥ 90 ? “Operational Excellence.”? Why it matters: Low adoption points to gaps in foundational usage. Alerts on adoption drops prompt the onboarding and enablement team to revise their training or onboarding playbooks.Concept #3: Engagement Is an Appetite/Maturity Hybrid Signal? Definition: Engagement quantifies how consistently and meaningfully clients participate in CS processes, including check-ins, roadmap reviews, and strategic planning. It signals operational stability when documented touchpoints are routine, and strategic intent when deeper, executive-level interactions occur.? How it works:? Cadence Adherence (30%): % of scheduled touchpoints held on time? Role Participation (20%): % of required stakeholders (execs/tech leads) attending? Decision Velocity (25%): Average days between proposal delivery and client approval (faster = higher appetite)? Activity Level (25%): Number of initiative-related interactions per quarter? Quadrant Insight: Low engagement + low adoption ? support focus (Goal 1, remains D quadrant). High engagement without corresponding adoption ? aspirational but underperforming (possibly B quadrant). High engagement + high CX ? strategic partner (Goal 4–5, A quadrant).? Why it matters: When engagement falls below the segment threshold (e.g., < 70% for a B-segment client), an alert triggers a review of the Engagement Strategy playbook (e.g., “Adjust meeting frequency or format”).Concept #4: Service Quality Is a Maturity Signal (Lower Strategic Impact)? Definition: Service Quality measures how reliably the MSP fulfills operational commitments, such as SLA compliance, on-time project milestones, and incident resolution. It’s primarily an operational (maturity) signal; low immediate strategic impact but high operational trust.? How it works: Quantitative (60%):? SLA Compliance (25%): % of tickets closed within SLA? On-Time Delivery (25%): % of milestones completed on schedule? Incident Recurrence (10%): % of issues reopened within 30 days (lower is better)? Qualitative (40%): Post-delivery client feedback on professionalism and clarity; internal governance audit scores. Segment Thresholds:? D (Goal 1): < 60 ? “At Risk”; 60–80 ? “Stable”; > 80 ? “Trusted.”? C (Goal 2): < 70 ? “At Risk”; 70–90 ? “Stable”; > 90 ? “Trusted.”? B (Goal 3): < 80 ? “At Risk”; 80–95 ? “Stable”; > 95 ? “Reliable.”? A (Goals 4–5): < 95 ? “Watch”; ≥ 95 ? “Exemplary.”? Why it matters: Poor service quality erodes operational trust. A service-quality alert prompts a review of the Service Quality playbook (e.g., incident escalation procedures) rather than auto-scheduling a meeting.Concept #5: Service Level Alignment Is a Hybrid Signal (High Strategic Impact)? Definition: Service Level Alignment measures how closely delivered services match the client’s current business goals, maturity, and appetite. It combines operational precision (maturity) with strategic fit (appetite), making it a leading indicator of retention and growth risk.? How it works: Strategic Fit (50%): Degree to which active services align to documented client objectives (validated via governance discussions). Scope Match (30%): Comparison of contracted service catalog versus actual consumed services. Client Perception (20%): Post-meeting survey (“Did our roadmap address your top priorities?”). Segment Thresholds:? D (Goal 1): < 50 ? “Misaligned”; 50–70 ? “Partial”; > 70 ? “Aligned.”? C (Goal 2): < 60 ? “Misaligned”; 60–85 ? “Partial”; > 85 ? “Aligned.”? B (Goal 3): < 70 ? “Misaligned”; 70–90 ? “Partial”; > 90 ? “Aligned.”? A (Goals 4–5): < 90 ? “Watch”; ≥ 90 ? “Fully Aligned.”? Why it matters: Misalignment between services and client goals is a high-risk signal. An alignment alert triggers a leadership review of the Service Level Alignment playbook (e.g., adjusting service tiers or updating contract language), not an automatic meeting.
Implementation ProcessStep 1: Establish Data Feeds for All Health Dimensions1. Client Experience (CX): Post-meeting CSAT/NPS surveys triggered via CRM/API; recorded call transcripts processed by an NLP sentiment engine; milestone-triggered feedback forms automatically sent after key deliverable reviews.2. Technology Adoption: Telemetry ingestion from PSA and IT management tools (e.g., endpoint protection logs, MFA enrollment logs); configuration compliance checks via RMM tools (e.g., patch status, backup success); usage reports from collaboration or cloud platforms pulled via API into a central data pipeline.3. Engagement: Calendar logs (Microsoft Graph, Google Calendar APIs) capture invitations, acceptances, and attendance; CRM events track proposal sends and approvals to measure decision velocity; PSA events are triggered when a support ticket is opened immediately after a scheduled session, indicating a potential engagement gap.4. Service Quality: SLA compliance data pulled from PSA (ticket open/close timestamps); project management tool events (e.g., “milestone completed”) imported via API; governance checklists and audit forms capturing qualitative feedback after each major delivery.5. Service Level Alignment: Contracted service catalog stored in CRM compared to actual consumed service logs; governance meeting notes ingested (via a shared repository or structured form) to capture alignment decisions; post-QBR alignment-check surveys sent (“Did our roadmap address your priorities?”).All feeds should flow into a centralized streaming infrastructure (e.g., Kafka, Amazon Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub) for real-time processing.Step 2: Define Scoring Models for Each Dimension1. CX Score (0–100):? Quantitative (60%): post-meeting CSAT (weighted by segment); survey response rate (low rate signals risk); NLP sentiment score from call transcripts (negative phrase frequency).? Qualitative (40%): thematic analysis of open feedback (“too technical,” “lack of direction”); structured flags (e.g., “executive expressed dissatisfaction”).? Segment Thresholds: ? D (Goal 1): < 50 ? “At Risk”; 50–70 ? “Watch”; > 70 ? “Healthy.” ? C (Goal 2): < 60 ? “At Risk”; 60–80 ? “Watch”; > 80 ? “Healthy.” ? B (Goal 3): < 70 ? “At Risk”; 70–90 ? “Watch”; > 90 ? “Healthy.” ? A (Goals 4–5): adaptive ML thresholds; significant deviation ? “Critical.”2. Technology Adoption Score (0–100):? Category & Insight Definition: for each primary technology domain, assign weighted insights (e.g., “MFA enabled on 90% of users” = 10 points, “endpoint AV compliance” = 10 points).? Compliance Calculation: earned points = (actual% % / target %) ? insight points.? Aggregate Score: sum all earned points, divide by total possible points, normalize to 0–100.? Segment Thresholds: ? D (Goal 1): < 50 ? “At Risk”; 50–70 ? “Partial”; > 70 ? “Stable.” ? C (Goal 2): < 60 ? “At Risk”; 60–80 ? “Partial”; > 80 ? “Stable.” ? B (Goal 3): < 70 ? “At Risk”; 70–90 ? “Partial”; > 90 ? “Stable.” ? A (Goals 4–5): < 90 ? “Watch”; ≥ 90 ? “Operational Excellence.”3. Engagement Score (0–100):? Metrics & Weights: cadence adherence (30%): % of scheduled touchpoints held on time; role participation (20%): % of required stakeholders (execs/tech leads) attending; decision velocity (25%): average days from deliverable to approval (faster = higher score); activity level (25%): number of initiative-related interactions per quarter.? Segment Thresholds: ? D (Goal 1): < 50 ? “Low”; 50–70 ? “Medium”; > 70 ? “Healthy.” ? C (Goal 2): < 60 ? “Low”; 60–80 ? “Medium”; > 80 ? “Healthy.” ? B (Goal 3): < 70 ? “Low”; 70–90 ? “Medium”; > 90 ? “Healthy.” ? A (Goals 4–5): adaptive ML thresholds; sudden drop ? “Critical.”4. Service Quality Score (0–100):? Quantitative (60%): SLA compliance (25%): % of tickets closed within SLA; on-time delivery (25%): % of milestones delivered on schedule; incident recurrence rate (10%): % of issues reopened within 30 days (inverted scale).? Qualitative (40%): post-delivery client feedback on clarity and professionalism; internal governance audit scores.? Segment Thresholds: ? D (Goal 1): < 60 ? “At Risk”; 60–80 ? “Stable”; > 80 ? “Trusted.” ? C (Goal 2): < 70 ? “At Risk”; 70–90 ? “Stable”; > 90 ? “Trusted.” ? B (Goal 3): < 80 ? “At Risk”; 80–95 ? “Stable”; > 95 ? “Reliable.” ? A (Goals 4–5): < 95 ? “Watch”; ≥ 95 ? “Exemplary.”5. Service Level Alignment Score (0–100):? Alignment Dimensions & Weights: strategic fit (50%): degree active services align with documented client objectives (governance validation); scope match (30%): contracted services vs. actual consumed services; client perception (20%): post-engagement survey (“Did we address your priorities?”).? Segment Thresholds: ? D (Goal 1): < 50 ? “Misaligned”; 50–70 ? “Partial”; > 70 ? “Aligned.” ? C (Goal 2): < 60 ? “Misaligned”; 60–85 ? “Partial”; > 85 ? “Aligned.” ? B (Goal 3): < 70 ? “Misaligned”; 70–90 ? “Partial”; > 90 ? “Aligned.” ? A (Goals 4–5): < 90 ? “Watch”; ≥ 90 ? “Fully Aligned.” Step 3: Build the Composite Health Engine1. Data Ingestion & Consolidation: Stream consolidated metrics for each dimension through a central pipeline (Kafka, Amazon Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub). Map each raw value to a 0–100 scale using the segment-specific thresholds above.2. Compute Composite Health Score: Formula: Composite Health Score = (CX ? 20%) + (Adoption ? 20%) + (Engagement ? 20%) + (Quality ? 20%) + (Alignment ? 20%). Adjust weights dynamically per segment (e.g., A-segment may weight Alignment and CX at 25% each). Recompute in real-time whenever new data arrives or ML models are updated.3. Derive Appetite/Maturity & Client Business Goal Level: Indices Computation: Maturity Index = (Adoption ? 0.4) + (Quality ? 0.3) + (Engagement ? 0.2) + (Alignment ? 0.1). Appetite Index = (CX ? 0.4) + (Engagement ? 0.3) + (Adoption ? 0.2) + (Alignment ? 0.1). Quadrant Mapping: plot Maturity vs. Appetite on a 5?5 grid to assign a “Client Business Goal Level” (1–5). When index values cross thresholds, generate an alert indicating a quadrant shift (e.g., Goal 2 ? 3). Downstream Update: automatically update the client’s segment and goal in the segmentation service so that Engagement Strategy and role assignments adapt accordingly.4. Alert Generation (Playbook Review Triggers): For each dimension crossing its risk threshold (e.g., B-segment CX < 60), create a high-priority alert. Alert Payload: triggered dimension (e.g., “Engagement < 70”); current Composite Health Score and all sub-scores; recommended playbook(s) to review (e.g., “Revise QBR agenda,” “Update onboarding/training workflow”); suggested owner roles (TAM, Senior CSM, vCIO) based on segment and dimension. Route alerts to the appropriate role queues via CRM or ticketing systems. Do not auto-schedule any new meetings; instead, prompt stakeholders to review and revise playbooks or processes.5. API Integrations (PSA, IT Management, CRM): PSA Integration: retrieve ticket status, SLA compliance, and incident logs to feed Service Quality and Scope Match scores. IT Management Tools: ingest endpoint compliance, patch status, MFA logs, and collaboration tool usage to feed Technology Adoption scores. MSP CRM: pull meeting schedules and attendance data for Engagement scoring; capture proposal sends/approvals for Decision Velocity; harvest survey responses and sentiment flags for CX. All API feeds flow into the Health data pipeline, ensuring that the appetite and maturity indices update dynamically.Step 4: Continuous Monitoring, Refinement & Governance1. Monthly Health Review Dashboard: Display distribution of clients across Health Score bands (0–20, 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, 81–100) by segment; break down sub-scores (CX, adoption, engagement, quality, alignment) by segment and track month-over-month trends; monitor quadrant shifts (e.g., percentage of clients moving from Goal 2 ? 3) and validate business outcomes.2. Feedback & Model Retraining: CSM Input: after responding to an alert, CSMs record the outcome (“Alert reviewed, playbook refined, next review in 30 days”). This feedback refines alert precision and reduces noise. Data Science Team: quarterly retraining of ML models used for anomaly detection or appetite/maturity indexing; incorporate labelled outcomes to minimize false positives/negatives.3. Threshold & Weight Adjustments: If Segment D accounts experience > 15% false alerts in a month, adjust rule-based thresholds or reweight sub-scores accordingly. If Segment A accounts repeatedly trigger “pseudo-misalignment” alerts (e.g., minor scope differences), revisit the alignment scoring formula to reduce noise.
AppendixHow does it connect to Client Business Goal levels?Goal LevelHealth Focus & Expected ActionOutcome1. Goal (Segment D)– CX: Simple post-support CSAT.Adoption: Typically < 50.Engagement: Quarterly check-ins; ≥ 60% cadence.Quality: SLA ≥ 90%.Alignment: Basic support; ≥ 50% alignment.– Alert Action: TAM receives a low-risk alert to review light-touch playbooks (“Quality < 80%” ? “revise incident escalation playbook”).– Result: Stable, predictable operations.2. Goal (Segment C)– CX: Combined CSAT + sentiment; moderate thresholds.Adoption: 50–70.Engagement: Monthly check-ins; ≥ 70% cadence.Quality: ≥ 85% on time.Alignment: ≥ 60% roadmap fit.– Alert Action: Rule/ML alert; TAM/SDM reviews (“Engagement < 70%” ? “refine QBR playbook”).– Result: Proactive correction, reduced churn risk.3. Goal (Segment B)– CX: High bar (≥ 70); ML anomaly detection.Adoption: 70–90.Engagement: Biweekly/monthly strategic sessions; ≥ 80% cadence.Quality: ≥ 90% on time, low recurrence.Alignment: ≥ 70%, quarterly strategic alignment.– Alert Action: ML-driven alert; Senior CSM + vCIO conduct a playbook-tuning session (e.g., “Alignment < 70%” ? “update strategic alignment playbook”).– Result: Proactive risk mitigation, deeper strategic engagement.4–5. Goal (Segment A)– CX: Near-perfect; adaptive ML thresholds.Adoption: ≥ 90%; continuous improvement.Engagement: Weekly/biweekly OKR-aligned sessions; ≥ 90% attendance.Quality: ≥ 95% on time; audit score ≈ 5/5.Alignment: ≥ 90%, continuous fine-tuning.– Alert Action: Top-priority alert to Strategic Advisor + vCxO (e.g., “CX dips < 90%” ? “review executive engagement framework”).– Result: Fully proactive, strategic partner collaboration.How does it connect to the other disciplines?? CS Strategy: Health alerts trigger dynamic re-segmentation. A client whose Maturity/Appetite indices reach Goal 3 moves to a higher segment, updating the Engagement Strategy and role assignments.? CS Deliverables: Health alerts can create “deliverable tasks” (e.g., “prepare updated roadmap,” “share adoption gap analysis”) instead of automatically scheduling a meeting.? CS People: Each alert includes recommended owner roles (TAM, Senior CSM, vCIO, vCxO), ensuring experienced stakeholders handle strategic-level issues.? CS Process: Health alerts serve as triggers for process workflows—e.g., “low adoption” alert activates an “Adoption Playbook Review” task.? CS Technology: The Health engine sits at the core of the tech stack—API integrations feed ML models and dashboards, driving all five CS methodologies with timely and reliable data.Product Links / Tooling Support

OverviewWhat is the objective?The Customer Success Deliverables methodology defines a product-agnostic, API-first architecture for generating and distributing CS outputs at scale. In a modern MSP, manually crafted reports are no longer sustainable: instead, diverse data sources—such as PSA, CRM, MRR feeds, RMM, and other IT-management tools—stream information on Strategy, Health, People, and Process into a centralized data layer. Once consolidated, automation and AI engines generate five core outputs in real time:? Reports: concise, visually structured summaries of client performance, risk, and outcomes? Proposals: actionable, client-specific recommendations for remediation, improvement, or new initiatives? Budgets: forward-looking forecasts, renewals, and cost analyses that enable financial planning? Strategy documents: structured, client-driven plans that link assessment insights and business goals to CS execution? Roadmaps: time-based, milestone-driven visualizations that track initiatives, dependencies, and execution progressEvery output is built and managed as part of a Closed Loop Theory approach—ensuring that every discovery insight and assessment intake is turned into a structured, client-driven strategy that closes the gap between listening and execution, and makes ongoing execution traceable through the roadmap and regular reviews. This accelerates follow-through, increases client buy-in, and delivers measurable business value with minimal delay.Those outputs become execution artifacts for downstream Strategy, Health, People, and Process modules. For example, a drop in Health Score triggers a risk report and updated proposal; a new assessment insight feeds directly into a revised roadmap or budget. Because the system is fully modular, any new data source, automation rule, or template can be easily integrated, so all Customer Success workflows always operate on the latest, actionable deliverables—closing the loop from input to outcome.Why is it important?A unified, product-agnostic Deliverables architecture ensures that all Customer Success outputs—reports, proposals, budgets, strategy documents, and roadmaps—are generated from the same real-time data foundation and are systematically linked to client business goals and actions. By consolidating all inputs into a single data layer and powering an automated output engine, the approach eliminates silos, manual effort, and inconsistent follow-through.With a modular, closed-loop process, every discovery, assessment, or client request immediately triggers the right deliverable—ensuring that insights turn into visible, trackable action. Each output is not only scheduled and permissioned, but also reviewed for engagement, feedback, and measurable results. This means:? No client concern or opportunity is lost between intake and execution.? Stakeholders always receive relevant, timely, and actionable deliverables tailored to their role and business context.? Roadmaps and strategy documents make it possible to track every initiative and deliverable from insight through to execution, review, and completion.In practice, this level of automation and process integration enables MSPs to:? Deliver polished, decision-ready artifacts the moment a client’s situation changes—whether it’s a health warning, a new risk, or an emerging business priority.? Track every output for acceptance, review, and action—closing the loop on client feedback and demonstrating the value of CS activities at every stage.? Enable more productive business conversations, faster approvals, and greater trust through total transparency.Why do I need to do this as an MSP?Without a standardized, closed-loop Deliverables system, MSPs risk missed follow-up, slow execution, and inconsistent client experience. Ad hoc proposals and hand-crafted reports cannot scale with a growing client base or shifting business needs.By adopting this methodology, you can:? Instantly convert discovery and assessment notes into actionable proposals, strategies, and roadmaps.? Ensure that every output—report, proposal, budget, or strategy—closes the loop on a client insight or request, with automated reminders for review and follow-up.? Tie every deliverable to a business goal, segment, or maturity level—ensuring relevance, buy-in, and measurable value.? Reduce cycle times: from insight to delivered proposal or strategic update in days, not months.Automated permission controls and governance features guarantee that the right people receive, review, and act on each deliverable, while outcome tracking (open rates, approvals, feedback) ensures every artifact drives real change—not just documentation.What is the Customer impact?Clients receive consistent, relevant, and actionable deliverables exactly when and how they need them—closing the loop between what is discussed and what gets done.? High-maturity clients receive executive-ready roadmaps, strategies, proposals, and budgets, all mapped to business objectives and KPIs.? Lower-touch accounts get concise, operational summaries with clear next steps—never generic, always client-specific.? Every deliverable is reviewed, commented on, or approved—and clients can see that their feedback or decisions directly result in visible action and updated plans.This process:? Builds tangible trust: clients see not only your insights, but also your execution.? Accelerates decision-making and momentum, with less delay and rework.? Makes every engagement transparent, auditable, and value-driven—anchoring the MSP as a partner who truly delivers on promises, from discovery to results.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: Deliverables Are Execution, Not StrategyDeliverables don’t define what strategy is—that’s the job of Segmentation, Engagement Strategy, and Playbook execution. Deliverables determine when and how actions are triggered and executed. They transform strategic intent into visible execution. They respond to inputs rather than define them. They act as structured outputs when the CS Process signals it’s time to act. For example:? Drop in Health Score ? triggers governance summary report? Updated roadmap ? triggers a proposal or budget generation? Contract renewal ? triggers a renewed budget forecastEvery deliverable—report, proposal, budget, strategy, or roadmap—is always produced using structured, API-accessible data from the MSP’s PSA, CRM, RMM, and assessment tools, and enriched with automation and AI for scalability, traceability, and relevance.All deliverables are generated and tracked as part of a Closed Loop Theory approach—every output is linked to a specific insight, intake, or decision, and its execution, review, and follow-up is logged for continuous improvement.Expanded with a Practical Example: After an assessment flags a backup gap, your CS platform’s automation layer creates a risk report block, drafts a proposal for remediation, and updates the roadmap—using data directly from your RMM and PSA via API. The report is presented live at the QBR, and client approval automatically triggers the start of the backup project workflow.Impact:? Every discovery or assessment is actioned quickly, not lost in notes? Clients see rapid movement from insight to execution? Automation, AI-based relevance and follow-up is needed—everything is structured, visible, and traceableConcept #2: Deliverables Are Shareable, Visible ValueA deliverable, such as a roadmap, proposal, or budget, is a tangible artifact that can be opened, shared, discussed, or approved. It is a portable, decision-ready snapshot that reinforces the MSP’s role.Every deliverable should be presented live whenever possible (not just emailed), turning it into an interactive client engagement.Deliverables reinforce trust, increase buy-in, and become shared memory across stakeholders. They should be:? Easy to understand and relevant to the client’s current Business Goal level? Visually apparent and structured with traceable business logic? Directly linked to roadmap status, budget impact, or service risksEach output is logged, versioned, and its client engagement (opened, reviewed, approved) is automatically tracked as part of the closed loop.Expanded with a Practical Example: For a quarterly roadmap review, the reporting tool assembles a visually engaging, segment-tailored PDF or presentation—including budget, upcoming initiatives, and previous proposal status. The meeting is held live, every attendee can view, comment, and digitally sign off on next steps. The system logs who opened and approved the document, triggering any required follow-up.Impact:? Clients feel ownership of the plan and see visible progress? The MSP can demonstrate value at every meeting with shareable, trackable artifacts? Audit trail supports governance, compliance, and renewal discussionsConcept #3: Deliverables Are Triggered, Not Ad HocDeliverables are part of an orchestrated Customer Success rhythm, not one-off reports generated reactively. They are generated in response to defined CS Process triggers:? Quarterly business review (QBR) meeting cycle? Introduction of a new stakeholder? Drop in CS Health ScoreThese triggers are defined as API event listeners or workflow automation, so that every deliverable is timely, consistent, and closed loop—nothing is left to chance or forgotten. Missed reviews or ignored deliverables escalate automatically for governance or follow-up.Expanded with a Practical Example: Whenever an assessment is marked “complete” in your CS system, the platform’s workflow engine auto-generates a consultant-style report, attaches the relevant proposal blocks, and notifies the assigned CSM to schedule a review call. If the deliverable isn’t opened within five business days, a reminder is sent, and a dashboard alert is created for management.Impact:? No key deliverable is ever forgotten or delayed? CS leaders see, in real time, where follow-through is missing? Proactive, not reactive, client managementConcept #4: Deliverables Are Modular, Block-Based ReportsIn Practice for an MSP:? Stop thinking in terms of one-off, handcrafted documents. Instead, build every deliverable—report, proposal, budget, strategy, or roadmap—as a set of “blocks,” each powered by a specific data source (e.g., Health, Budget, Initiative, Third-Party Risk).? How to use it:? Use a report composer to select and arrange blocks for the deliverable: e.g., Quarterly Roadmap, Proposal Pipeline, Budget Forecast, Health Score Trend, Assessment Summary.? Integrate both native and third-party blocks via API (e.g., security summaries, compliance scores, insurance risk, productivity analytics).? Save configurations as templates by segment, goal, or scenario (“Segment B – Modernization Proposal” or “Quarterly Strategy Update”). If a stakeholder changes, you can simply swap or add blocks without redesigning the entire deliverable.? All deliverables are versioned and template logic is stored as code (YAML/JSON) for audit and continuous improvement.? Why it matters:? If stakeholders change (new CFO, compliance officer), you can simply swap blocks without redesigning the whole report.? You can respond quickly to new reporting requirements—add a new TAP block when a partner integration becomes available, or customize for a specific client’s hot topic.? Pro Tip: Ask your client which blocks they find most valuable, and use those preferences to fine-tune future reporting for higher engagement.Concept #5: Deliverables Are Automated for Both Delivery and PresentationIn Practice for an MSP:? Don’t rely on manual report assembly and email chains! Use the Deliverables module to automate both the timing and delivery format of every report.? How to use it:? Set up automated schedules (e.g., “Send a QBR summary every quarter”; “Trigger a Risk Assessment report after any major project closure”).? Decide whether to deliver by email, secure client portal, or live via Presentation Mode.? Live Presentation Mode: Use this for executive briefings or QBRs—full-screen, interactive, and synced in real time with the client’s actual LMX data.? Hide internal-only blocks (like notes or draft initiatives) from the client, showing only approved, client-ready content.Automation ensures every client receives deliverables on time, with real-time tracking of opens, approvals, and feedback. Missed or unreviewed deliverables are auto-flagged for CS or governance intervention.? Why it matters:? Automation guarantees that no client is missed and every report goes out on time, every time.? Live presentations enable more interactive, engaging discussions and make it easy to drill into relevant details without exposing sensitive information.? Pro Tip: Use open rates and client feedback to refine scheduling—if a report is rarely opened, try a different cadence or presentation format.Concept #6: Permissions, Branding, and Governance Are Built-InIn Practice for an MSP:? Control exactly what each person can see, edit, or present in every deliverable—right down to the block level.? How to use it:? Set block-level permissions (e.g., “Internal Only” for risk notes, “Client Visible” for summary stats).? Define who (vCIO, TAM, CSM) can create, edit, or approve each report template or block.? Apply your client’s branding to every export (logo, corporate colors, custom fonts).? Archive every report sent or presented, keeping a date/versioned history for compliance or audit purposes.? Why it matters:? Prevents accidental disclosure of internal or sensitive information.? Ensures every deliverable looks professional and consistent with your client’s own standards.? Makes it easy to prove what was delivered and when, supporting governance and QBR review.? Pro Tip: Use governance dashboards to track report engagement, monitor who opened each file, and follow up with feedback requests after important presentations.Concept #7: Third-Party (TAP) Integration Expands Deliverables’ ValueIn Practice for an MSP:? Go beyond just your own LMX data—make reports more valuable by incorporating best-in-class metrics from external partners.? How to use it:? Connect TAP integrations (MDR/EDR providers, insurance risk platforms, compliance or productivity analytics) via the ScalePad Hub.? New blocks from each integration automatically appear in the Report Composer; simply drag them into your next report.? Combine, for example, a native “Roadmap” block with a “Security Risk Score” from an MDR provider and a “Microsoft 365 Usage Trends” block from a productivity analytics partner.? AI-driven normalization ensures that third-party blocks look and feel consistent with your native reporting style.? Why it matters:? Offers clients a single, unified report that covers all critical business, technical, and risk data—without needing multiple tools or sources.? Helps differentiate your MSP’s QBRs and executive briefings by offering deep insights, not just basic status updates.? Pro Tip: Ask TAP partners for recommended best-practice blocks and pre-configured visuals—this can make your reporting both richer and easier to produce.Concept #8: Closed Loop Theory – Every Deliverable Drives and Tracks ActionThe foundation of the Deliverables methodology is Closed Loop Theory:? Every deliverable (report, proposal, budget, strategy, roadmap) is tied to a discovery insight, assessment intake, or client request? Each output is tracked for delivery, review, approval, and outcome? Actions (accept, reject, comment) trigger the next CS workflow; no feedback = auto-reminder/escalation? All results are logged for continuous improvementExpanded with a Practical Example: After an executive report is presented, approval triggers roadmap updates and project kickoff; rejection triggers review and proposal revision. All steps, feedback, and next actions are auto-logged and visible to the CS and leadership team.Impact:? No insight, risk, or opportunity is ever lost? CS performance is measured not just by delivery, but by follow-through and outcome? Clients see a living process, not static documents—commitment and trust are built into the rhythm of engagement
Implementation ProcessStep 1: Determine the Type and Frequency of Deliverables? This configuration step must be defined in advance by the MSP as part of their CS Strategy (segmentation, engagement rhythm, and role planning)? It is not the job of the deliverables system to decide what to send—it only executes what was designed? Determine:? report cadence (e.g., monthly, quarterly);? deliverable formats (e.g., tactical summary vs. strategic roadmap); ? stakeholder roles (who receives and presents what)Step 2: Aggregate Data from Structured Sources? Deliverables must be based on reliable, structured data sources, such as PSA (support activity, SLAs), MRR and billing tools (contract value, renewal periods), CRM (stakeholder mapping, engagement logs), RMM (device health, usage stats), assessments and roadmap history.? The data should be consolidated into a unified system or data layer to ensure accuracy and accessibility.Step 3: Select Template and Configure Components? Choose a deliverable template based on the client’s segmentation or Business Goal level and the type of CS interaction (e.g., QBR, renewal, initiative review)? Configure sections such as strategic goals and risks, initiative updates and KPIs, budget forecasts and financial metrics, CS Health summaries (Engagement, Adoption, Alignment)Step 4: Use AI to Generate Narrative and Visuals? AI adds interpretability and personalization to structured data: ? narrative (e.g., “Last quarter, three initiatives closed, risk reduced by 40%.”);? visuals (auto-generated roadmaps, budget charts, risk trends);? personalization (adjust tone and content for executives, technical users, or project sponsors)Step 5: Present or Deliver and Log the Interaction? Deliverables should be presented live during strategic or QBR sessions where possible; delivered via email or client portal with confirmation tracking; logged with metadata such as delivery date, recipient, view status, and next steps.? If a deliverable is ignored or unacknowledged, trigger alerts or follow-up workflowsStep 6: Trigger Downstream Events Based on Delivery? Deliverables should initiate action: proposals are approved or modified, roadmaps are updated, CS cadence is recalibrated, and governance escalations are launched when deliverables aren’t reviewed or presented.? These workflows must be governed by predefined automation rules that ensure follow-through.
AppendixHow does Deliverables connect to Client Business Goal levels?Client Business Goal LevelDeliverables FocusDownstream Impact1. Technology SupportDeliverables provide operational visibility and service assurance: basic ticket summaries, backup/asset status, and compliance logs.Reporting is auto-generated, lightweight, and standardized for “keep-the-lights-on” stability. Minimal meetings or presentations. Deliverables reinforce trust and SLA coverage for low-maturity, low-appetite clients.2. Technology EnablementDeliverables expand to cover project tracking, stack alignment, and milestone progress, often through quarterly QBRs and simple roadmaps.Reports start to visualize technology adoption, standardization efforts, and key initiative status. Engagement with deliverables increases, helping clients recognize progress in enablement and supporting their move to higher maturity.3. Technology ModernizationDeliverables become central to the client relationship: detailed modernization roadmaps, lifecycle assessments, and budget projections.Formal QBRs and documentation drive collaboration. Deliverables support prioritization of modernization initiatives, ensure accountability, and give clients visibility into the full range of services and improvement opportunities.4. Business TransformationDeliverables shift to executive-level, outcome-driven assets: cross-departmental roadmaps, KPI dashboards, and business impact reports.Reports are designed for multi-stakeholder use, driving strategic decisions, productivity improvements, and process optimization. Presentation mode and interactive reviews become standard.5. Business InnovationDeliverables are co-developed: innovation roadmaps, OKR-tracking reports, advanced analytics, and multi-year investment decks.Reports facilitate innovation steering, align technology investments to business outcomes, and provide visibility for executive and departmental leadership. Deliverables help the MSP act as a co-innovation partner, not just a provider.How does Deliverables connect to other CS disciplines?? Client Business Goal: Deliverables are directly tailored to the client’s business goal level and segment. Every report, roadmap, or proposal is mapped to the client’s current maturity and appetite, ensuring relevance and value at every stage.? CS Strategy: Deliverables are built from playbook-driven templates, aligned to the engagement cadence and strategic priorities set in the CS Strategy blueprint. Reporting workflows and standards become more sophisticated as clients advance in maturity and segment.? CS Health: Engagement with deliverables (opens, reviews, follow-up actions) is a live indicator of client health and engagement. Deliverables visualize Health metrics (Adoption, Alignment, Service Quality, etc.), and any lack of interaction with deliverables can trigger CS Health interventions or governance workflows.? CS Deliverables: The Deliverables module operationalizes all output artifacts—reports, budgets, roadmaps, and proposals—making them visible, actionable, and tied to playbooks and strategic outcomes. Deliverables are versioned, permissioned, and audit-trailed for full transparency.? CS Process: Deliverables are generated at key workflow milestones—after Discovery, Assessment, or Meeting steps—ensuring that every process rhythm is documented and every stakeholder receives the right artifact at the right time. Automated delivery and Presentation Mode integrate reporting into the process flow.? CS People: Clear ownership of deliverable creation and presentation is mapped by role (e.g., vCIO for strategy, TAM for technical health, CSM for initiative follow-up). Playbooks and templates enable every CS team member to confidently deliver outputs suited to the client’s segment and goal.

OverviewWhat is the objective?The CS Technology People methodology defines a product-agnostic, API-first architecture for the Customer Success ecosystem. In this model, an average mid-tier MSP with 15–25 employees cannot rely on offline spreadsheets or manual coordination to stay up-to-date. Instead, diverse data sources—such as PSA, CRM, MRR feeds, RMM, and other IT-management tools—stream raw Strategy, Health, Deliverables, and Process information into a centralized data lake or warehouse. Once data is consolidated, AI-powered engines automatically generate core outputs in real time: role assignments, enablement triggers, compensation recommendations, and governance alerts. Those AI-generated outputs become the operational instructions for the downstream Strategy, Health, Deliverables, and Process modules.Why is it important?A unified, API-first People architecture ensures that the same real-time data foundation drives all Customer Success role activations, enablement steps, and compensation decisions. Poorly aligned roles and responsibilities can make CS delivery either too costly (over-assigned vCIOs) or under-scoped (no roadmap owner). By consolidating disparate signals into a single data lake and continuously feeding AI engines, the methodology prevents silos, eliminates manual handoffs, and accelerates operational responsiveness. In practice, this level of automation allows MSPs to assign the right CS resources the moment a client’s Health Score shifts, to launch targeted training the instant a new initiative is approved, and to trigger governance reviews before a renewal is at risk.As an MSP, why do I need to do this?Without a standardized People backbone, MSPs end up juggling spreadsheet-based role rosters, ad-hoc enablement checklists, and manual compensation calculations, making it nearly impossible to scale or maintain consistency. The CS Technology People methodology provides the reusable components needed to automate every aspect of CS operations, without rebuilding the wheel each time you hire a new CSM, onboard a vCIO, or adjust compensation targets. This means you can deploy a new enablement flow in days instead of weeks, reassign underutilized resources the moment a client’s engagement dips, and align compensation to outcomes automatically, all while keeping internal overhead to a minimum.What is the Customer impact?Clients experience a consistently intelligent, structured MSP presence that adapts to their evolving needs. Strategic clients automatically receive senior executive involvement as soon as their Health Score indicates higher maturity, while lower-touch accounts get precisely the right level of coverage without wasted effort. When a client’s roadmap stalls or their Health Score drops, an alert fires and the recommended CSM or vCIO is assigned within minutes, ensuring proactive follow-up rather than reactive scrambling. This leads to:? Consistent, context-rich engagements: Clients constantly interact with the correct CS role based on their current needs, not on outdated org charts.? Faster response to risk: Early signal detection (e.g., low engagement) triggers immediate role activation and enables, preventing churn.? Clear accountability and transparency: Every client sees that a dedicated customer success owner is responsible for their success, which boosts trust and alignment.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: The Application Process Is an Execution Engine, Not a StrategyThis blueprint doesn’t define your strategy—it operationalizes it. Strategic decisions, such as segmentation, role definitions, or engagement models, occur upstream. But strategy, left alone, doesn’t scale. The Application Process blueprint turns those choices into live, trigger-based execution systems. ? When segmentation places a client in Segment B, the Application Process decides when to assign a CSM and how to enable that role. ? When a roadmap is approved, it triggers governance logic and initiative tracking automatically, not manually. ? When CS Health drops due to Engagement or Adoption, escalation is triggered before a renewal is at risk. This concept repositions the People layer from static org design to real-time orchestration. It ensures that every motion in the CS Process (Assessment, Meeting, Proposal) activates the right people at the right time for the right reason. It’s not “who owns this?”—it’s “what conditions trigger this role to act?”Concept #2: Process Triggers Drive Role Activation, Not SegmentationSegmentation is essential—but insufficient. Knowing a client is in Segment A doesn’t mean they’re ready for full strategic engagement. Conversely, a Segment C client who just approved their first roadmap may now need a different role mix. That’s why role assignment must be process-driven, not assumption-based. ? After Discovery Intake reveals multi-departmental needs, vCIO activation is triggered—even for a Segment B client. ? When a Proposal is delivered but no Budget is aligned, CS Manager involvement is triggered to course-correct. ? When cadence is broken (e.g., QBR skipped), Governance may step in with escalation workflows. These transitions aren’t based on “feeling” readiness—they’re based on observed events in the CS Process discipline. This protects CS teams from over-delivery and ensures clients only receive roles and resources when activity justifies it. It creates a living segmentation overlay powered by behaviour and outcomes.Concept #3: API Data + AI Interpretation Powers the People LayerManual people management doesn’t scale—but data does. The future of CS People's execution is API-fed, AI-interpreted automation. First, you collect relevant signals: ? process milestones (QBRs held, reports delivered, roadmaps approved), ? health indicators (drops in Engagement, plateaued Technology Adoption), ? role activity (initiative follow-through logged, governance events triggered). Then, intelligent rules or AI logic interprets these inputs and recommends or even executes actions: ? “Assign CSM to Segment B client—Engagement dropped post-roadmap.” ? “Trigger Enablement flow for AM—first-time proposal delivery for Segment A.” ? “vCIO follow-up required—initiative marked stalled for >45 days.” This framework unlocks continuous alignment of people resources with client conditions. It reduces both CS overexertion and underperformance, keeping delivery lean, relevant, and automated where possible.Concept #4: Role, Enablement, and Compensation Actions Are Triggered—not Assigned ManuallyMost MSPs rely on managerial intuition to assign people, define training needs, or review bonuses. That works—until the team scales or client complexity increases. The Application Process replaces ad-hoc decision-making with triggered people ops. ? Assigning a TAM happens when Assessment Intake identifies risk in the core stack.? Enablement is deployed when a CSM is involved in their first budget conversation.? Compensation bonuses are unlocked when CS Health scores improve consistently across an account over three months. These trigger events are derived from Product (Delivery + Process) activity, not from human memory. This ensures:? Fair and timely compensation that aligns with verified client outcomes? Enablement that is targeted, contextual, and responsive to maturity growth? Role clarity that evolves with client needs, not just annual reviews In short, every part of the People blueprint—roles, responsibilities, enablement, compensation—is made dynamic. Instead of a playbook in a drawer, it becomes a responsive system triggered by measurable events.Concept #5: Governance and Health Create the Feedback LoopThe Application Process doesn’t just launch actions—it learns from them. For this to happen, you need a feedback loop powered by governance oversight and CS Health metrics. Every triggered action should generate measurable outcomes. ? Assigning a vCIO should lead to improved strategic alignment and roadmap execution.? Launching enablement should show better follow-up after meetings or proposal success.? Triggered governance should resolve process gaps before renewal risk escalates. Governance validates: Did the triggered action happen? Was it documented? Did it help? Meanwhile, CS Health metrics indicate whether the intervention was effective—providing the quantitative signal. Together, these feedback loops enable the MSP to continuously refine the Application logic by tightening triggers where actions were too late, softening them where actions were unnecessary, and calibrating resource allocation to reflect the actual CS effort. This is how the Application Process becomes self-improving—a governance-aware, data-responsive engine for delivering the proper CS engagement, role, and impact at scale.
Implementation ProcessStep 1: Map Available API Data PointsIdentify key structured data sources across platforms:?  From PSA: MRR, service types, client creation date, assigned resources? From RMM: hardware/software aging, lifecycle coverage, agent health? From CS tools: last meeting date, proposal volume, Health Score changes? From CRM: opportunity status, decision-maker rolesThis step builds the foundation for all downstream People automationStep 2: Enable AI to Interpret Key Client ShiftsUsing the API data, define interpretation rules such as:?  3 lifecycle touchpoints in 6 months ? likely maturity growth? Initiatives approved + roadmap meeting complete ? shift to Business Goal Level 4+? High ticket volume with no strategy meetings ? potential misalignmentThese interpretation models allow the system to make role and enablement decisions based on patterns, not just status.Step 3: Define Trigger Points for Role, Enablement, and Governance ActivationKey trigger events may include:? New client creation? First Discovery meeting completed? Assessment scored above a threshold? Proposal accepted / initiative approved? CS Health drops by 2+ points? QBR cadence overdueEach trigger should initiate a rule-based action, such as assigning a vCIO, launching a training flow, or initiating a governance check-in.Step 4: Link Trigger Outcomes to the People LayerEach trigger outcome maps directly to People’s actions:? Role activation: assigning TAM, AM, CSM, vCIO roles by segment? Enablement launch: sending relevant milestone training, talk tracks, or context materials? Compensation adjustment: updating targets for bonus calculation (e.g., new roadmap initiative)? Governance scheduling: logging a quarterly review or scorecard auditThese are automated, but reviewable, allowing humans to override or validate if needed.Step 5: Monitor System Effectiveness and Close the LoopUse internal reports to check:? Role coverage gaps (e.g., clients with no CS contact in 90 days)? Enablement adoption (e.g., training completed post-trigger)? Compensation fairness (e.g., reward vs. responsibility match)? Governance completion (e.g., QBRs logged, Health reviewed)Over time, refine the rules and triggers to better align with client outcomes and MSP capacity.

OverviewWhat is the objective?The CS Technology Process methodology defines a product?agnostic, API?first architecture for the Customer Success ecosystem. In this model, an average mid?tier MSP with 15–25 employees managing more than 100 clients cannot rely on offline spreadsheets or manual coordination to stay up-to-date. Instead, diverse data sources—such as PSA, CRM, MRR feeds, RMM, and other IT-management tools—stream raw information about Strategy, Health, Deliverables, and People into a centralized data lake or warehouse. Once data is consolidated, AI-powered engines automatically generate orchestration instructions in real time, turning every CS process into a reusable, versioned workflow. Those AI-generated outputs become the operational instructions for the downstream Strategy, Health, Deliverables, and People modules.Why is it important?CS process rhythm is the backbone of an MSP’s operational model. Without it, there's no consistent client experience, no scalability, and no quality control. A well-functioning CS Process system forms a closed loop: every trigger, whether calendar-based or anomaly-based, automatically results in a scheduled meeting, task assignment, or intervention.With the right combination of data, rules, and automation, the entire process chain (Discovery Intake, Assessment Intake, Meeting, Initiative, Governance) becomes executable, whether initiated by cadence or KPI-based logic.As an MSP, why do I need this?Closed-loop execution ensures that every signal leads to action, such as a meeting, initiative, or review. Versioned, code-defined workflows enable auditable, scalable execution. Automation and AI can prepare execution steps, such as personalized Discovery and Assessment forms, and extract and prepare Initiatives from meeting notes. Without a standardized Process backbone, MSPs end up with ad?hoc task lists, missed triggers, and inconsistent follow?ups, making it impossible to execute CS strategies as they evolve reliably.What is the Customer impact?Clients experience a consistent, visible, and responsive engagement:? Reliable follow?through: No signals are lost—every alert or milestone generates the appropriate process step.? Timely execution: Documentation and follow?ups are generated and delivered just-in-time, based on data-driven triggers.? Data-driven recommendations: AI-prepared materials (Discovery forms, agendas, initiative drafts) ensure each interaction is highly relevant and decision-ready.
Important Concepts ExplainedConcept #1: The CS Process is an Execution EngineDefinition: The CS Process blueprint does not define what actions should be taken—that’s determined upstream by segmentation models, CS playbooks, and strategic role design. Instead, it exists to explain when and how those decisions should be executed. It is the operating system that brings strategic intent to life.How it works:? When a QBR approaches, a Discovery Intake form and Meeting agenda are generated without manual action.? When a new stakeholder is added to the CRM, a Discovery Intake trigger is launched, ensuring they are included in context-rich interactions.? When roadmap milestones are reached, follow?up assessments or initiative updates are prepared and presented.Why it matters: Decisions without execution lead to stagnation. Once a CS decision is made—whether related to cadence, governance, or segmentation—the downstream workflows are enacted automatically, reducing reliance on memory or manual effort. Execution becomes predictable, scalable, and reliable.Concept #2: Every Event Becomes a Feedback PointDefinition: In an orchestrated CS Process, nothing is “just data.” Every event—calendar-based, metric-based, or manually entered—has the potential to initiate action. This transforms the Customer Success system into a continuous feedback loop.How it works:? A scheduled cadence (e.g., quarterly rhythm) triggers the generation of QBR meetings and pre-meeting tasks.? A drop in usage metrics automatically triggers a reassessment of engagement risk and the generation of a tailored assessment.? The onboarding of a new contact triggers an opportunity for updated Discovery, role-specific assessment, or context briefing.Why it matters: Without this kind of automation, signals are often missed or delayed, especially in lower-touch segments. Making every event actionable ensures no opportunity for value creation is lost. It’s especially crucial for early-stage, low-maturity, or less-engaged clients, where proactive outreach can significantly alter the growth trajectory.Concept #3: Process Control Requires Structured DataDefinition: No orchestration system can function effectively without a foundation of high-quality, structured data. The quality of your automation depends on the quality, consistency, and accessibility of your inputs.How it works:? Key inputs come from structured platforms, such as the MSP’s CRM (contacts, engagement logs), PSA (support tickets, SLAs, project status), RMM (device usage, uptime, patch compliance), and other IT management systems.? Financial data, such as MRR trends or budget history, provides the business context for cadence and initiative planning.? These data streams are merged into a unified layer, often via an integration platform or data warehouse.Why it matters: A process engine without structured data is like a car without fuel. Inaccurate, fragmented, or delayed data leads to broken workflows, misfires, and poor client experiences. Centralized, consistent data enables precise orchestration and agile response.Concept #4: AI Enhances Preparation and InsightDefinition: Artificial Intelligence in CS Process automation doesn’t replace humans—it enhances execution by preparing the right materials, identifying gaps, and making recommendations based on data patterns.How it works:? AI builds personalized Discovery and Assessment forms using client metadata (e.g., segment, industry, maturity level).? It transcribes and analyzes meeting notes to extract suggested initiatives and playbook actions.? It detects gaps (e.g., initiative delays or governance cadence drift) and suggests corrections (e.g., “add roadmap review to next meeting”).Why it matters: By automating the preparation phase, AI eliminates one of the biggest bottlenecks in CS execution. This allows CS team members to focus on interpretation, decision?making, and relationship management, not on formatting slide decks or recalling cadence dates. It ensures every process step is informed by the latest data and optimized for client relevance.Concept #5: Versioned, Reusable, Auditable Workflow CodeDefinition: The CS Process is more than a list of tasks—it is a codified, modular system that can be versioned, reused, and improved over time. Each process is treated as code.How it works:? Workflow logic (triggers, conditions, outputs) is stored as modular building blocks.? Each version of a workflow can be audited, rolled back, or adapted to a different client segment.? All actions are logged and traceable, providing a complete audit trail from trigger to execution.Why it matters: This approach supports standardization, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance. More importantly, it enables the CS organization to evolve its process logic over time without losing fidelity. As service offerings change or segments evolve, workflows can be rapidly updated and version-controlled without requiring the rebuilding of the entire system.
Implementation ProcessStep 1: Define Trigger Points and Timing Logic? Not defined by the Process system, but required as configuration by the MSP (based on segmentation, CS strategy, playbooks).? Examples:? Segment B ? Quarterly QBRs? Segment A ? Weekly check-ins or KPI-based alertsStep 2: Aggregate Structured Data Inputs? Unified data collection from:? CRM (contacts, engagement)? PSA (tickets, projects, SLAs)? RMM (assets, usage)? Financial systems (MRR, budget history)? Optionally enhanced by roadmap, health, and assessment toolsStep 3: Configure Event Triggers and Response Paths? Define what triggers which process:? New stakeholder ? triggers Discovery Intake? Usage drop ? triggers Assessment? Roadmap milestone ? triggers governance meetingStep 4: Automate Execution with Templates and AI? Auto-generate:? Discovery or Assessment forms (based on client profile)? Meeting agendas, next steps, summary decks? Draft initiatives from meeting transcriptsStep 5: Execute, Track, and Refine? Present deliverables live or post to the portal? Log views, openings, and interactions? AI reviews missed steps and proposes cadence changes or process improvements.
AppendixHow does it connect to the Client Business Goal levels?? Goal 1–2: Fixed cadences, basic automation. Monthly reviews, standard discovery surveys.? Goal 3: Hybrid approach. Scheduled meetings enhanced with signal-based deep dives (e.g., triggered by usage or ticket volume).? Goals 4–5: Full orchestration. Meetings and assessments are initiated dynamically, with real-time signal detection and self-adjusting playbooks.How does it connect to the other parts?? Customer Success Strategy: Implements the logic and rhythm defined by segmentation and playbooks to drive effective outcomes.? Customer Success Delivery: Automates the preparation and execution of reports, proposals, budgets, and initiatives to streamline processes and enhance efficiency.? Customer Success Health: Collects and responds to Health Score triggers, triggering governance when engagement or alignment declines.? Customer Success People: Assigns correct roles to each meeting or initiative based on scope and importance.? Customer Success Technology – Deliverables: Ensures that deliverables, such as reports and roadmaps, are triggered, prepared, and delivered in the correct cadence.
Quickstarters
Chapter: How to Start — The CS Quickstarters“Blueprints are the system. Quickstarters are your ignition.”By now, you've seen the depth of the CS methodology—the frameworks, the quadrant models, the strategic loops. It's powerful, but it can also feel overwhelming. The question we kept hearing from the field was simple:“Where do I start?”That’s why we built the CS Quickstarters.Quickstarters are focused, role-based launch kits that quickly take you from zero to value. Each one is designed to help a specific person, like an Account Manager, vCIO, or CS leader, run their first high-impact CS motion in hours, not months.What Are CS Quickstarters?Each Quickstarter is a guided mini-sprint, purpose-built to help you:? Apply the CS methodology to a real-world situation? Learn just enough theory to act with confidence? Use AI tools and templates to streamline the process? Drive a specific business outcome (not just “do more CS stuff”)They are the fastest path from intention to execution. Whether you're trying to understand a client’s goals, structure your CS team, or build your first strategy framework, there's a Quickstarter.What’s Inside a Quickstarter?Every CS Quickstarter has the same structure, so once you’ve used one, you’ll know how to approach the others:ComponentPurposeObjectiveThe clear business outcome you’ll drive—e.g., “Find one client’s business goals.”Five CoursesEach step teaches one concept or skill needed to hit the objective.Matching MethodologyThe simplified version of a blueprint that powers the execution.AI ToolGuides the user through each step, answers questions, and helps with deliverables.DeliverablesTangible outputs like segmentation docs, roadmaps, role maps, or SOPs.Each quickstarter typically takes:? ~1 hour of learning (digestible course content, self-paced or workshop-style)? ~2 hours of practice (client-facing time, team planning, or hands-on building)This isn’t just a workshop. This is execution. You’re doing real CS work with real clients—just structured in a way that builds your skill and confidence fast.Use Case: One Client, One OutcomeLet’s say you’re an Account Manager just starting to embrace CS. Your quickstarter might be:? Objective: Find and document one client’s business objectives.? Five steps: Learn segmentation, discovery questions, enrichment, how to run a discovery, and how to close the loop.? Deliverables: A real client roadmap, complete with initiatives and proposed budget.That’s not theory. That’s value delivery.Who Are Quickstarters For?Each Quickstarter is built for a specific role and CS maturity stage:? AMs, TAMs, and vCIOs ? Focused on one-client execution (Client Goals Quickstarter)? CS Leaders or Owners ? Focused on team, process, and structure (CS Strategy, Team Quickstarters)? Service or Sales Teams ? Supporting roles with clarity on impact and integration.And because an AI Copilot supports every step, users are never stuck—they always have next steps, coaching, and blueprint references one click away.Why They WorkCS Quickstarters solve the activation gap.Most CS initiatives stall because they require teams to learn everything before doing anything. Quickstarters flip that. They’re designed to get you doing real work within two hours, with just enough structure to build confidence and deliver value.This is how we scale success. One outcome. One client. One playbook at a time.

Course Outline - CLient Goals
Client Goals Quickstarter - Course OutlineCourse #1: New Ways of SegmentationSubtitle: How to Identify What Each Client Can Do and Wants to DoOriginal ProblemMost MSPs segment clients using outdated or oversimplified criteria, such as revenue, the number of endpoints, or vertical. But this often leads to mismatched service levels, wasted effort, and missed opportunities. High-paying clients get strategic attention even when they resist change. Smaller clients are ignored—even when they’re eager and capable. As a result, CS teams struggle to prioritize their time, proposals misfire, and initiatives stall because the proper drivers of success—maturity and appetite—aren’t visible. Without a better segmentation model, Customer Success stays reactive and inconsistent.PurposeThis course introduces a powerful, practical segmentation method using Appetite for Change vs. Technology Maturity — helping CS professionals ditch MRR-based guesswork and start tailoring strategy based on behaviour, mindset, and capability.Learning ObjectivesBy the end of this course, participants will be able to:? Explain why traditional segmentation (MRR, #users, vertical) falls short.? Apply a 2x2 segmentation framework to categorize clients based on:? Appetite for Change (buy-in, urgency, momentum)? Maturity (tools, adoption, operational capability)? Assign clients to one of four Archetypes: Transform, Modernize, Educate, or Sustain? Use segmentation to tailor customer success (CS) engagement and project scope.Core Content Outline1. The Pitfall of MRR-Only Thinking • Why MRR ≠ Maturity • Why high-revenue clients often have low-impact potential (and vice versa)2. The 2x2 Client Segmentation Model • Vertical Axis: Technology Maturity • Horizontal Axis: Appetite for Change • Quadrants: ?• Transform (High/High) – Strategic champions; ready for big moves ?• Modernize (Low/High) – Ambitious, needs structure ?• Educate (High/Low) – Stable, needs inspiration and clarity ?• Sustain (Low/Low) – Minimal change, risk-managed touchpoints3. Common Pitfalls in Misalignment • Trying to “Transform” a Sustain client • Overinvesting in clients with low appetite • Using the same QBR template for everyone4. The CS Leverage Effect • How segmentation allows you to prioritize time, elevate the proper accounts, and activate the Growth LoopPractice ExerciseTitle: Archetype Mapping Sprint • Choose one active client • Plot them on the Appetite vs. Maturity matrix • Assign a primary Archetype • Write two engagement strategy statements per client: ?• “For [Client X], we will prioritize ___.” ?• “We will avoid ___ to reduce friction.”Strategic OutcomeParticipants walk away with a Segmentation Matrix and Archetype Playbook for one client of their choice, ready to guide roadmap, QBR cadence, and initiative framing.CS Toolkit:Toolkit #3 – Client Business Discovery – Use the starting page to plot the client within the Appetite vs. Maturity quadrant. This enables quick, visual segmentation and forms the foundation for downstream alignment in CS Health, Roadmap Planning, and Proposal Strategy.
Course #2: What Your CEO Wants You to KnowSubtitle: How to Prep for Strategic Conversations Like a Business Partner, Not a Tech VendorOriginal ProblemCustomer Success conversations often stop at infrastructure, licensing, or projects. However, executive stakeholders think of strategic outcomes, such as growth, efficiency, and risk. MSPs that can’t connect the dots between IT services and business priorities lose credibility, stall roadmap momentum, and stay stuck in tactical conversations. Without structured business enrichment, CS teams often appear unprepared, and clients tend to treat them like vendors rather than partners.PurposeThis course trains CS professionals to gain a deep understanding of their clients' business context, enabling richer discovery conversations and better alignment between IT initiatives and executive priorities.Learning ObjectivesBy the end of this course, participants will be able to: • Research and interpret key business indicators that influence client priorities • Enrich client profiles with strategic context (vertical, size, pressures, goals) • Identify high-leverage use cases for IT tied to revenue, risk, or efficiency • Develop a Discovery Brief that links client pain points to potential projectsCore Content Outline1. The “CEO Filter” • Why most QBRs fail to land: they’re too technical • How CEOs think: goals, risks, ROI, velocity • What they don’t want: specs, features, jargon2. Strategic Enrichment: Research Framework • Use structured enrichment tools to analyze both industry and client-specific context • For industry, extract key insights on: ?• IT-critical business processes ?• Common risk and compliance challenges ?• Industry-wide technology trends and disruptions • For a client, extract: ?• Core products, services, and target markets ?• Business model and revenue drivers ?• Recent updates (e.g., growth, hires, acquisitions) ?• Key stakeholders and decision-makers • Combine both sets of insight into a business-literate profile that informs Discovery3. Translate Business Context into Strategic Hypotheses • “If this client just acquired a new location, they likely care about…” • “If they’re in manufacturing and hiring, workforce productivity may be key…” • Link hypotheses to proposed IT initiatives or solution categories4. Craft the Discovery Brief • Write a one-page summary that includes: ?• Client snapshot ?• Key goals ?• Industry and business context ?• Strategic hypothesesPractice ExerciseTitle: Discovery Brief Sprint • Select one client from your CS portfolio • Use enrichment tools to research: ?• What they sell, who they sell to ?• Industry dynamics ?• Recent company updates or hires • Identify three likely business goals they have right now (use the Client Goal Pyramid: Support ? Enablement ? Modernization ? Transformation ? Innovation) • Write a Discovery Brief with: ?• Client snapshot ?• Key goals ?• Strategic hypothesesStrategic OutcomeParticipants complete the course with a finished Discovery Brief, which prepares them for roadmap planning, QBRs, or upcoming executive meetings, providing a clear understanding of the business context behind client needs.Toolkits or TemplatesThe CS Toolkit #3 – Client Business Discovery tool follows a structured enrichment-first approach: Step 1: Automated Enrichment 	• Client Summary – Captures company-specific context (e.g., size, location, revenue indicators, leadership, services, recent news, competitors, and technology stack). 	• Industry Summary – Captures sector-wide context (e.g., industry IT needs, cybersecurity trends, compliance risks, business models, and operational dependencies).Step 2: Strategic Hypothesis Generation • Links enrichment findings to probable client priorities • Suggests areas for follow-up or framing in future meetings • Prepares CS professionals to align recommendations with the executive mindset
Course #3: How to Come Across as a ConsultantSubtitle: Ask the Questions That Shift You From Vendor to Strategic PartnerOriginal ProblemEven well-prepared MSPs often ask the wrong questions—those that sound technical, transactional, or vendor-like. As a result, strategic opportunities are missed, and the client views the MSP as a service provider rather than a partner. Without a transparent questioning methodology aligned with business outcomes, CS professionals fail to establish executive trust or uncover the fundamental levers for growth, efficiency, or change.PurposeThis course trains CS professionals to lead with curiosity and business acumen, replacing technical checklists with strategic dialogue and informed decision-making. It focuses on how to ask powerful, business-aligned questions that elevate your role from vendor to advisor.Learning ObjectivesBy the end of this course, participants will be able to: • Distinguish between technical vs. strategic discovery questions • Lead client conversations that surface business goals, risks, and constraints • Use question frameworks that establish trust and elevate positioning • Avoid "vendor framing" by using language and sequencing that aligns with executive prioritiesCore Content Outline1. The Power of Strategic Questions • “He who asks the questions controls the conversation” — Josh Braun • From spec talk to strategic talk: Why consultants ask different questions • How questions influence perception: expert vs. executor2. Anatomy of a Great Discovery Question • Open-ended, non-leading, insight-generating • Tied to outcomes: growth, efficiency, risk, revenue • Designed to uncover what matters, not just what’s broken3. Methodology: Power Questions + 3 Strategic Discovery Areas • Power Questions – Engage executives, surface vision, create space for meaningful conversation • Business-Focused Questions – Expose goals, metrics, and department initiatives • Integrated Business–Technology Questions – Bridge pain points with IT opportunities • Technology-Focused Questions – Reveal infrastructure, service, and workflow needs • Apply frameworks like: ?• 3-Why Ladder: Why now ? Why this ? Why us? ?• PACT: Problem, Alternatives, Consequences, Transformation • Use the Goal Pyramid and client quadrant to calibrate tone, ambition, and language4. Do’s and Don’ts of Discovery Delivery Do: • Mirror language, summarize goals, probe deeper Don’t: • Pitch solutions early, talk features, and overuse acronymsPractice ExerciseTitle: Consulting Conversations Drill • Select one client (ideally using the Discovery Brief from Course 2) • Choose their Archetype and Goal Level • Use the Strategic Discovery Question Bank to write five custom questions to: ?• Uncover strategic goals ?• Surface hidden pain ?• Understand timelines and internal blockers • Role-play with a peer or manager in a mock QBR or roadmap session • Record “What we heard” and “What we should explore next.”Strategic OutcomeParticipants conclude with a personalized Discovery Question Bank tailored to real clients, along with practice in delivering them with confidence and strategic impact.Toolkits or TemplatesThe CS Toolkit #3 – Client Business Discovery tool generates tailored discovery questions automatically based on structured enrichment. After the client’s Industry Summary and Client Summary are completed (see Course 2), the tool uses the client’s Appetite ? Maturity quadrant and the stakeholder’s seniority level (e.g., owner, C-level, manager) to generate personalized questions across four strategic categories:Power Questions Open-ended prompts that engage senior decision-makers by surfacing their vision, frustrations, and executive ambitions. Example: What would success look like for your business if technology perfectly supported your strategy?Business-Focused Questions Expose goals, KPIs, department initiatives, and competitive drivers that shape the business context for technology alignment. Example: What are your top three business objectives for the coming year?Integrated Business–Technology Questions Bridge operational realities with technology opportunities, revealing how IT can remove bottlenecks or accelerate outcomes. Example: Are there workflows that could benefit significantly from automation or AI?Technology-Focused Questions Target current-state infrastructure, service quality, and process gaps—anchoring conversation in measurable improvements. Example: Are there recurring tech issues your team continues to raise but haven’t yet been solved?This automated output allows CS professionals to arrive prepared with relevant discovery questions, be business-aware, and be calibrated to the stakeholder’s mindset, so every meeting feels more like a consulting session than a check-in.
Course #4: How to Unpack a DiscoverySubtitle: Turn Meeting Notes Into Roadmaps That Clients Say Yes ToOriginal ProblemDiscovery meetings often feel productive, but then stall. CS professionals take notes, but struggle to convert them into tangible next steps. Roadmaps remain vague, proposals get delayed, and assessments fall short. The result? Clients view the MSP as a good listener, rather than a strategic driver. Discovery remains passive without a method for transforming raw conversations into focused action, and business outcomes fail to materialize.PurposeThis course teaches CS professionals how to synthesize discovery conversations into strategic initiatives, map those initiatives to client goals, and structure a next-step output that supports annual planning, proposal development, or in-depth assessment—depending on the client's readiness.Learning ObjectivesBy the end of this course, participants will be able to: • Extract relevant insights from client discovery sessions • Translate raw inputs into clear goals, initiatives, and timelines • Prioritize initiatives using the Goal Pyramid + Archetype model • Identify when to advance toward planning, scoping, or assessment • Build a structured output ready for annual strategy and planningCore Content Outline1. From Conversation to Commitment • What clients say vs. what they mean: filtering signal from noise • Spotting initiatives: recurring pain, time-sensitive issues, executive interests • Why most roadmaps and proposals fail: too vague, too technical, or disconnected from business context2. Goal–Initiative–Planning Mapping Framework • Client Goal ? “Improve remote collaboration” • Initiative ? “M365 optimization project” • Planning View ? phased effort across quarters or key business cycles3. Prioritization by Appetite & Maturity • Use segmentation to determine scope, timing, and format • Low maturity clients ? project scoping and quick wins • Moderate maturity ? annual initiative planning and budgeting • High maturity ? full funnel flow: Discovery ? Assessment ? Roadmap4. From Discovery to Deliverables • When to turn outputs into a scoped proposal (validated, contained need) • When to escalate into planning (multi-topic, medium maturity readiness) • When to move into assessment (deep dive on risk, complexity, or unknowns)5. Annual Planning Context • How Discovery outputs become the launchpad for structured annual plans • How Goals, Topics, and Initiatives carry forward into roadmaps and budgets • Why clarity at this stage improves cadence, confidence, and CS HealthPractice ExerciseTitle: From Memo to Motion Plan • Upload or reference a recent meeting memo or discovery notes • Identify and extract: ?• Key business goals ?• Repeated challenges ?• Executive concerns or constraints • Draft: ?• 3 strategic initiatives (each labelled with Client Goal alignment) ?• Estimated time/effort or delivery rhythm ?• Output recommendation: project scope, annual plan, or assessment• Submit your draft as: ?• Title, Objectives, and aligned Client Goal ?• Client segment and maturity ?• Suggested next step (proposal, planning, or assessment)Strategic OutcomeParticipants leave with a structured output anchored in Discovery, but purpose-built for strategic use at the next step. Based on the client’s maturity, this output may: • Feed directly into a scoped project proposal • Advance to structured annual planning with roadmap and budget • Trigger a focused assessment to validate deeper risk or complexityRather than leaving Discovery as “just a conversation,” this course equips CS professionals to guide clients toward the right planning path with confidence and clarity.Toolkits or TemplatesThe CS Toolkit #3 – Client Business Discovery tool supports live intake and post-meeting synthesis. It organizes insights using a five-box canvas:• Client Industry Information – Sector context, tech trends, and risk triggers • Client General Information – Locations, size, growth signals • Client Business Information – Strategic drivers, department goals • Business Technology Information – Collaboration, enablement, and process gaps • Technology Infrastructure Information – Systems, lifecycle, asset gapsAfter input is refined, the tool generates: • A draft Client Business Goal • Suggested Topics for follow-up • Candidate Initiatives based on maturity, appetite, and strategic postureThis structured output empowers CS professionals to translate insights into one of three strategic paths:1. Project Scope – For low-maturity clients ready for contained action2. Annual Plan – For mid-maturity clients with multiple aligned topics3. Assessment Intake – For high-maturity clients needing structured validation before initiative framingThe result is a confident transition from Discovery to structured CS execution, tailored to each client’s stage and business model.
Course #5: Perfect Closed Loop Follow-upSubtitle: How to Turn Roadmaps Into Action Without Losing MomentumOriginal ProblemDiscovery insights and roadmaps often sound promising, but then stall. CS professionals generate great recommendations but lose traction in the follow-through. Clients disengage without a straightforward method to translate discovery into action, through assessments, scoped initiatives, or structured proposals, and momentum fades. Strategic wins become missed opportunities because there’s no clear path from idea to execution.PurposeThis course helps CS professionals close the loop after discovery—converting strategic intent into scoped initiatives, validating needs through assessment, and preparing action-ready outputs that drive execution inside LMx or internal workflows.Learning ObjectivesBy the end of this course, participants will be able to: • Build an initiative follow-up plan based on discovery outputs • Select the right path: assessment, project scope, or roadmap-based planning • Use assessments to validate urgency and prioritize action • Draft a client-facing project scope aligned to business value and stakeholder expectations • Package discovery outputs into execution-ready artifactsCore Content Outline1. The Risk of Dropping the Ball • Why great discoveries often die in the follow-up • “Consultant ghosting” vs “Trusted advisor closure” • How strategic CS wins are lost without tight execution2. Closed-Loop Execution Framework Discovery ? Roadmap ? Scope ? Proposal ? Execution • Assessment ? Validate risk, uncover urgency • Project Scope ? Define success criteria, milestones, and stakeholders • Initiative Planning ? Link to Client Business Goals, budget, and timeline • Proposal or QBR Update ? Finalize buy-in and transition to delivery3. Choosing the Right Path by Maturity • Low Maturity: Use Discovery insights to build a single Project Scope (focused, contained, ready to propose) • Mid Maturity: Roll outputs into a structured Annual Plan (Roadmap + Initiatives + Budget) • High Maturity: Follow the whole Funnel: Discovery ? Assessment ? Initiative ? Budget4. Strategic Follow-Through Techniques • How to transition from recommendation to commitment • Framing scope in terms of ROI, business continuity, or efficiency • Anchoring initiative alignment to Client Goal and Archetype • Preparing decision-makers using phased budget thinkingPractice ExerciseTitle: Assessment ? Scope ? Roadmap Flow • Choose one initiative from your Discovery output • Select the best-fit pathway: ?• Assessment – For complex, high-stakes, or compliance-sensitive topics ?• Project Scope – For validated needs requiring proposal packaging ?• Roadmap – For multi-topic planning over time • Complete the following for your selected path: ?• Assessment Summary – Key risks, urgency, and impact if ignored ?• Project Scope – Outcomes, roles, timeline, and three high-level milestones ?• Roadmap View – Show timing and priority over the next 3–6 months • Create a presentation-ready slide or page with: ?• Initiative overview ?• Business goal alignment ?• Supporting insight (Assessment or Discovery) ?• Suggested cost/budget tierStrategic OutcomeParticipants leave with a Client Initiative Package: a scoped deliverable based on real Discovery inputs and structured for execution—whether inside a roadmap, a project proposal, or an LMx-based assessment. The outcome is traction, not just insight.Toolkits or TemplatesPrimary Follow-up CTAs (via Business Discovery Tool ? LMx integration):1.

Promo Page – Why Strategic Business Discovery FailsThree signs your MSP is “winging” business discovery:? You ask the same generic questions in every meeting—no client context, no impact.? Discovery is seen as “checklist time” or awkward sales, never as a strategic conversation.? Discovery notes live in a silo: they don’t feed goals, initiatives, or CS Health.What’s Actually Broken: ? You lack industry and client-specific context, so the questions land flat.? You don’t tailor the conversation to client maturity, appetite, or business priorities.? You can’t quickly translate insights into initiatives, goals, and CS follow-ups.Here’s Your Fix: The Business Discovery Canvas This tool bridges the gap by:? Gathering deep, up-to-date industry and client intelligence—zero touch.? Connecting business discovery directly to strategic planning, so every conversation builds toward actionable outcomes and future initiatives.? Selecting a discovery style tailored to each client’s segment and strategic context.? Instantly generating segment-aware, high-impact questions—no more generic lists.? Integrating discovery notes and follow-ups directly into your CS and planning workflows.? Personalized. ? Actionable. ? Scalable.
App Cover PageMost MSPs run discovery “on autopilot.” You ask some questions, but don’t know if you’re missing what matters or if your advice is even relevant. True business discovery is more than a checklist: it’s about understanding the real-world pressures your client faces, the industry trends shaping their decisions, and the goals that drive their investments.The Business Discovery Tool fixes this by guiding you step-by-step through structured information gathering, quadrant targeting, and actionable follow-up. It connects the dots between what you learn in discovery and how you plan your Customer Success initiatives, ensuring every insight is translated into future roadmap items, strategic planning, or tactical projects.By the end, you’ll:? Understand your client’s industry and context better than their competitors.? Have a clear, tailored list of discovery questions for every maturity/appetite profile.? Document, organize, and operationalize client insights for maximum impact—not just in CS Health or QBRs, but throughout your CS planning.
Step 1: Enrich Your Client and Industry UnderstandingEvery successful Customer Success Strategy begins with a deep understanding of your clients, not just their IT infrastructure, but their business context, industry pressures, and strategic objectives. Step 1 is where we lay the groundwork for strategic business discovery and planning by gathering and organizing two key types of information:? Client Information: Specific details about the organization’s size, market, leadership, revenue, locations, known initiatives, and technology environment. This sets the stage for relevant, high-impact conversations.? Industry Information: Up-to-date research, sector trends, competitor activity, regulatory challenges, and typical pain points facing organizations like your client. This ensures your discovery is always rooted in the client’s business reality.By combining these two layers, you don’t just ask better questions—you unlock the ability to connect business discovery directly to strategic planning, assessment, and roadmap execution. The tool leverages AI-powered search to automatically gather and structure the most relevant information about each client and their sector. It gives you a proper foundation for all future CS planning and engagements.Why is this enrichment significant?? Relevance: Knowing your client’s business model, industry trends, compliance needs, and key decision-makers enables you to tailor IT solutions and advice to what matters.? Differentiation: Industry intelligence helps you stand out from “one-size-fits-all” competitors by letting you connect IT outcomes to sector-specific challenges and opportunities.? Efficiency: Automated enrichment eliminates the need for manual research, delivering structured, actionable insight that accelerates playbook preparation, roadmap design, and proposal writing.What is Client Enrichment and Industry Enrichment?Client Enrichment means using AI to collect and organize key facts about your client’s locations, size, management, value proposition, core offerings, and recent news. Industry Enrichment means pulling in up-to-date trends, risks, compliance frameworks, and business models for your client’s sector so that you can position IT recommendations in the proper context.How does the tool gather and structure this information?? AI Search & Data Aggregation: The tool queries public data, company websites, LinkedIn, news feeds, and business registries to compile the most recent and relevant information—zero manual effort required.? Structured Output: Each client and industry profile is organized into clear fields (e.g., Industry Overview, Client Locations, Key Competitors, Technology Stack), ensuring consistency and easy review.? Anti-Hallucination: If sufficient data is unavailable, the tool flags this so you can supplement it later—no speculation, only facts.What types of information are collected?Client Information (example fields):? Locations: Where does the client operate?? Size & Revenue: How big are they, and what is their scale?? Key Contacts: Who are the IT decision-makers and influencers?? Value Proposition: What makes them stand out in their market?? Core Products/Services: What do they sell or deliver?? Recent News: Any acquisitions, new technology investments, awards?? Technology Stack: What IT tools, platforms, and vendors do they use?? Partnerships: Who are their strategic partners or alliances?? Competitors & Market Position: Who are their rivals, and how do they compare?Industry Information (example fields):? Industry Overview: What are the defining features of this sector?? Trends & Opportunities: What new technologies or shifts are on the horizon?? Challenges: What pain points or disruptions are common?? Compliance: Which regulations are most critical?? Business/IT Challenges: Typical risks, standard tech struggles? Technology Opportunities: What’s being adopted (cloud, automation, etc.)?? Revenue Models & Processes: How do businesses in this industry make money, and which IT systems are mission-critical?? Supply Chain Risks: Are there any notable dependencies?What if the tool can't find all the details?? You will be prompted to review and complete any missing fields manually.? You can always add, edit, or clarify information to ensure accuracy.? The more you refine the enrichment, the more tailored and credible your Customer Success strategy will be for each client.How can you improve enrichment accuracy?? Supplement automated results with internal notes from onboarding, QBRs, or past projects.? During business discovery, ask clients to validate key data points (e.g., tech stack, compliance requirements).? Regularly update enrichment profiles as clients grow, merge, or shift focus.
Step 2: Select Your CS Strategy Target (Maturity–Appetite Quadrant)The second step in effective Business Discovery is defining the primary business context you want to uncover for the client you are about to meet. In this tool, you select a single focus quadrant from the proven Maturity–Appetite framework—clarifying whether your main objective is to identify a client ready for innovation, one needing operational stability, or another combination. This selection ensures that your downstream discovery questions will be relevant to this client's real business state and ambition.
What is the Maturity–Appetite Quadrant? The Maturity–Appetite model is a proven segmentation framework that classifies a client based on two axes:? Maturity: How standardized, aligned, and operationally advanced is the client’s environment?? Appetite: How ready and willing are they to pursue strategic improvement and invest in change?In this tool, you’ll select one of four archetypal quadrants as the primary focus for your Customer Success discovery with this client:? Transform (High Maturity, High Appetite): “Transform your client’s business with innovative solutions.” Select this if you want to explore opportunities for co-innovation, OKR-level alignment, and proactive, business-led change with a highly advanced, engaged client.? Modernize (Low Maturity, High Appetite): “Modernize your client’s technology stack.” Select this if the client is eager to improve but needs guidance to standardize, consolidate, and upgrade their IT—your goal is to help them move up the maturity curve.? Educate (High Maturity, Low Appetite): “Educate your client about the benefit of your services.” Select this if the client has a solid, standardized environment but shows little openness to change—your aim is to surface value and spark appetite for improvement.? Sustain (Low Maturity, Low Appetite): “Sustain your client’s business growth.” Select this if the client prioritizes stability, reliable service, and minimal disruption—your CS approach will focus on efficiency and maintaining trust.Why does this selection matter?? It sets the strategic tone for your Business Discovery session—defining what “success” means for this particular client.? It focuses your preparation and conversation on communication strategies that best fit this client's real business context.? It ensures that your recommendations, and follow-up are aligned to a clear, client-specific business goal.How should you select your target quadrant?? Review what you know about the client so far: Do they show signs of readiness for transformation, or are they mostly focused on stability and operational basics?? Consider your pre-meeting research: Look for clues in recent project history, assessment results, or client communications that indicate their current maturity and appetite.? Think about your meeting objective: Are you aiming to inspire innovation, remove friction, help them catch up with industry standards, or simply maintain their trust?What if the client’s situation is complex or in transition?? If your client seems to straddle more than one quadrant, start by focusing on their most urgent or strategic business need today.? You can adjust your approach as more information comes out during the discovery conversation.? As the relationship develops, you can shift the CS strategy focus to support their evolving priorities.How can you refine your choice over time?? Revisit your client’s quadrant classification after major assessments, quarterly reviews, or significant business changes.? Use feedback from this and future meetings, plus any updated CS Health metrics, to confirm your focus and fine-tune discovery questions for maximum relevance.? As you gather more data, you can reclassify the client and update your CS approach to match their new reality.
Step 3: Review and Complete Client InformationAt this stage, you review and finalize all the foundational data about your client that was auto-enriched in Step 1. The Client Discovery Canvas presents two key sections: Industry Information and Client Information. This is your opportunity to validate, complete, or adjust these fields to ensure the context for your engagement is accurate and relevant. By grounding your Customer Success process in up-to-date, client-specific information, you set the stage for high-impact discovery conversations and actionable planning.By completing this step, you create a reliable foundation for the next phase: generating highly relevant discovery questions and tailored presentations.What is included in Industry and Client Information?? Industry Information: These fields capture your client’s industry sector, common market challenges, regulatory requirements, and typical business models. The tool pre-populates this data using best-available public information and your own client database, so you get a jump start on understanding what’s likely to matter in your upcoming discovery.? Client Information: Here you’ll see specifics about your client organization, such as company size, main lines of business, geographic scope, leadership contacts, and any known technology platforms. These details are pulled from your CRM, public sources, or manually entered during onboarding.Why is this review step important?? Ensures all discovery questions and recommendations are anchored in the real client context, not generic assumptions.? Builds trust with the client, demonstrating that you’ve done your homework and understand their world.? Surfaces missing or outdated data that might otherwise derail a meeting or initiative later.? Supports compliance and risk management by making industry requirements visible up front.How should you review and update these fields?For many smaller companies—or for clients in niche or less-documented industries—it’s common that limited public information is available about the organization. As a result, some fields may be pre-filled with incomplete or outdated data, or may be missing entirely.? Compare pre-filled fields with your latest CRM records and notes from recent client conversations to ensure accuracy.? Fill in any missing information or correct errors (for example, if there have been recent mergers, changes in ownership, or shifts in business focus).? For industry-related information, check that the listed challenges, market trends, and compliance notes actually reflect the client’s current profile and priorities.? Leverage your firsthand experience with the client’s vertical or unique situation—add details from recent projects, regulatory changes, or local market conditions that may not be captured in public sources.? If the tool fails to capture a critical point, simply edit or add it directly—this is your opportunity to make the Client Information and Industry Information sections genuinely actionable and relevantWhat if you’re missing information or unsure about an entry?? Reach out internally to account managers, vCIOs, or others who know the client best.? You can always return to this page to update the information as more data becomes available.How can you improve the quality and impact of your client information over time?? Review and refresh industry and client-specific info at the start of each major initiative, QBR, or annual review.
Step 4: Get Discovery QuestionsPersonalized discovery questions are the foundation for high-impact client meetings. The tool presents a tailored set of 19 questions on this page, generated based on your earlier inputs about the client, industry, and business priorities. Each question is designed to spark meaningful dialogue, uncover pain points, and reveal strategic opportunities, going beyond generic templates.What Are Discovery Questions and Why Are They Important?Discovery questions help you understand your client’s real goals, challenges, and context. A well-crafted set of questions will let you move from surface-level conversations to a genuine strategic partnership. When you ask about the business environment, industry trends, digital enablement, and infrastructure, you show the client that you understand their world and are prepared to add value, not just push solutions.What Types of Discovery Questions Are Included? The tool’s questions are based on the six key types identified in modern MSP discovery methodology:? Warm-Up Questions: Build rapport and set the tone for an open, trusting conversation.? General Business Discovery: Surface high-level objectives, business pain points, and key initiatives.? Industry-Specific Questions: Demonstrate domain expertise and contextual intelligence about the client’s sector.? Digital Enablement: Identify opportunities for process modernization, automation, or digital adoption.? IT Strategy & Optimization: Explore how current technology infrastructure supports or limits the client’s growth.? Next Steps & Commitment: Clarify alignment, confirm priorities, and define what progress or follow-up should happen next.Each question is accompanied by a brief explanation to help you understand its intent and tailor your approach in real time.How are the Questions Personalized?The tool uses client information (location, size, business model), your team’s vertical competency, and industry data to generate context-rich questions. You’ll see not only general business questions, but also prompts tied to current market pressures, technology maturity, and compliance factors specific to the client’s sector.A short explanation follows each question in square brackets, so you understand the intent behind the question and can adapt your follow-ups in real time.What Should You Do on This Page?? Review the information: Carefully review the automatically enriched Client Information and Industry Information sections on this page. Consider if all key facts about your client, their context, and their industry are present and accurate.? Add missing details externally: If you notice anything incomplete or want to enhance the information, simply copy the text into your preferred text editor, make your edits, and save the updated version for your own records or for later upload.? Go back if needed: If you recall additional data or context—such as new client contacts, industry changes, or specific business goals—you can always navigate back to the previous step in the wizard and update the relevant fields there. This ensures that your strategy foundations are as accurate and comprehensive as possible.? Generate your summary: Once you are satisfied, proceed to the next step or use the available “Create Presentation” function to generate a downloadable PDF containing your current enriched data. This can be shared internally or used as a handout for upcoming meetings.What if the Questions Don’t Fully Fit?If you feel some questions do not match this client or this meeting’s context, you can always copy the text into your preferred editor to adjust or supplement it before use. The tool’s initial suggestions are a starting point—real strategic value comes from tailoring your approach to each client’s current situation, industry challenges, and business objectives.If, as you progress, you realize there’s more information you want to include (for example, additional details for Client Information or Industry Information), simply go back to the previous step in the wizard and add or update those details. This flexibility ensures that your discovery process is always aligned with the latest, most accurate inputs.How Can You Improve Your Discovery Approach?? If you find, after moving forward, that you want to enrich the Client Information or Industry Information further, you can simply return to the previous step to add the new details.? Track which questions lead to the most valuable insights, and incorporate that feedback into your evolving discovery sessions. This continuous improvement approach will maximize the value of every client interaction.
Step 5: Add Business Discovery Meeting NotesCapturing accurate notes during the Business Discovery meeting is essential to ensure that client context, needs, and goals are understood and reflected in the Customer Success plan. For those learning the process or looking for inspiration, the “Generate Sample” option provides an AI-generated set of meeting notes based on the client and industry summaries and standard discovery questions. This is a starting point to illustrate the expected structure, but remember: every real meeting is unique, and you should always tailor the notes to fit your specific conversation and client.What is the purpose of Business Discovery Meeting Notes? Business Discovery meeting notes capture the key topics discussed, client context, business drivers, pain points, and opportunities identified during your initial consultative session. They are the foundation for downstream assessments, playbooks, and initiative planning.Why is this important?? Ensures all stakeholders are aligned on client objectives and challenges? Enables the MSP to personalize follow-up actions and proposals? Prevents loss of context between meetings or when team members change? Supports auditability and continuous improvement of the CS processHow should you capture or generate notes?? Use structured note-taking templates provided by your CS platform or CRM? For new users, click “Generate Sample” to create example notes, which are based on your client’s industry, company profile, and typical discovery questions? Immediately after the meeting, review and revise notes to ensure accuracy? Attach discovery notes to the client record for easy access and collaborationWhat if you have limited experience?? Use the sample notes as a starting point and adapt them to your client’s situation.? Over time, build a library of real meeting notes as references? Ask more experienced CS team members to review or co-author your first notesHow can you improve the quality of your notes?? Include both business and technology context: business priorities, technology adoption challenges, and any change signals? Record direct client quotes and key decision-maker insights? Tag notes with relevant topics (e.g., compliance, growth, risk, innovation) for easier search and reporting
Step 6: Review Client Discovery CanvasThe Client Discovery Canvas gives you a structured, at-a-glance summary of everything you’ve learned about your client, from meeting notes, enriched website data, and earlier steps in the wizard. This is where you finalize your understanding of the client’s current business and technology environment before moving into CS planning, roadmap development, and playbook execution.A key advantage of the Discovery Canvas is that it brings together two previously captured inputs:1. Industry Information — the client’s vertical, with its typical workflows, compliance needs, and technology stack.2. Client Information — the client’s own business model, size, positioning, and strategic focus.In addition to these, the Discovery Canvas also integrates structured notes from your Business Discovery meeting:? Business Discovery — what’s changing in the client’s business environment, goals, and pain points? Business Technology Discovery — business process enablement, how technology supports or limits the client’s operations? Technology Infrastructure Discovery — current IT stack, key risks, lifecycle issues, and readiness for changeThis unified view ensures that Customer Success planning is aligned to both macro-level industry context and micro-level client reality. With the Canvas, you have a comprehensive yet actionable starting point for building relevant playbooks, aligning roadmap items, and setting up initiatives that truly match each client’s priorities and environment.What does the Client Discovery Canvas show?The canvas is structured to help your team prepare for high-value client conversations, especially those involving strategic initiatives or quarterly/annual planning. It shows:? Business-facing details like client size, ownership model, and growth posture? Operational readiness indicators (e.g., number of users, sites, locations)? Strategic intent, such as M&A readiness, compliance-driven initiatives, or AI ambitions? Technology posture through a simplified infrastructure viewInstead of collecting this data ad hoc, the canvas standardizes your prep work across all accounts, creating consistency, saving time, and enabling segment-specific playbook delivery.Why is this step necessary?Good CS planning starts with context. You'll default to tactical conversations if your team enters a QBR or strategic meeting without understanding the client’s business structure, vertical nuances, and technology maturity. The Discovery Canvas ensures:? Everyone is on the same page before planning begins? Strategic guidance is aligned to the client’s world, not just your stack? Playbooks are relevant, and reporting is focused on business valueClients don’t just want tech recommendations—they want advisors who understand what makes their business tick.How are these discovery topics mapped?The Discovery Canvas is broken into three areas that support the Customer Success journey:1. Business Discovery? Used to surface innovation appetite and OKR alignment? Examples: organizational growth goals, competitive positioning, key metrics, M&A activity2. Business Technology Discovery? Highlights the digital transformation potential and internal process friction? Examples: workflow automation needs, cross-departmental collaboration gaps, compliance pressures3. Technology Infrastructure Discovery? Captures operational status of the stack and signals upgrade readiness? Examples: outdated firewalls, legacy on-prem servers, poor patch hygieneEach section gives input into whether a Discovery or Assessment should trigger a roadmap initiative, risk remediation, or standardization effort.What if your discovery input is incomplete?That’s normal. The Canvas is designed to evolve as your relationship with the client deepens. You can:? Pre-fill using website enrichment, and past meeting notes? Refine during planning conversations? Update before major engagements like budget reviews or strategic planningHow can you improve discovery accuracy?? Standardize who fills in the canvas and when—ideally after Discovery Intake (4.2) and before a significant CS milestone like 4.3 Assessment or 4.4 Meeting.? Use vertical-specific templates to guide questions and validation? Assign ownership (e.g., AM, CSM, vCIO) and include updates in your CS Health rhythm? Cross-reference assessment and roadmap outputs to close any gaps over time
Step 7: Transform Discovery into Goals, Topics, and InitiativesCapturing raw notes from meetings is not enough—actual Customer Success impact comes from converting those notes into action. This step is where business discovery meets strategic planning. Step 7 operationalizes the Closed Loop Theory, ensuring that every discovery insight is turned into a structured, client-driven strategy that closes the gap between listening and execution.The Closed Loop Theory teaches that effective MSPs always transform their Discovery into three structured outputs:? Client Business Goals (what the client ultimately wants to achieve)? Strategic Topics (the key focus areas or business functions that connect goals and action)? Initiatives (the concrete, measurable actions the MSP will deliver to address those topics)This approach ensures that business-side insights from Discovery don’t get lost in a silo, but instead become the foundation for roadmap planning, initiative scoping, and client engagement strategy. By explicitly linking discovery to strategic planning, you maximize every client conversation’s value and align your Customer Success activities with what truly drives business impact.What information gets transformed here?At this step, your discovery notes are structured into three layers:? Business Goals: These are the client’s long-term, high-impact outcomes (e.g., risk reduction, expansion, or improved efficiency) that guide all future technical and business decisions.? Topics: These are thematic areas or business functions (such as “device lifecycle” or “change management”) that group related issues and context under each goal, creating clarity for discussion.? Initiatives: These are specific, actionable projects or solutions (such as “deploy UEM platform” or “standardize onboarding checklist”) that the MSP will deliver, directly tied to the identified goals and topics.Together, this structure transforms raw conversation notes into a clear, actionable framework for strategic planning and execution.Why is this step necessary?? Closes the Loop on Discovery: By parsing discovery data into Goals, Topics, and Initiatives, MSPs ensure that valuable client input is not lost or ignored, but carried through to roadmap, QBRs, and planning.? Prepares for the Meeting: Ideally, it should be done right before your strategic planning meeting. This ensures you enter with clear, validated client goals and initiative candidates.? Drives Engagement and Accountability: Clients are more committed to initiatives they helped define through Discovery or Assessment, especially when the framing reflects their own words and goals.? Builds Playbook-Ready Inputs: These outputs can be immediately used to structure roadmap reviews, initiative proposals, and budgeting.How does Discovery turn into structured goals and plans?? Conduct Discovery early—before your Annual Strategic Meeting. Ideally, schedule and complete Business Discovery 4–6 weeks ahead of your strategic planning session. This gives you time to collect, process, and organize the client’s inputs without rushing.? Use your Discovery Canvas as a foundation. Review the AI-generated Business Goals, Topics, and Initiatives produced by the tool from your Business Discovery  Canvas notes. This helps you quickly surface recurring themes and spot both strategic objectives and operational pain points.? Assign targeted Assessments when deeper analysis is needed. If a new goal, challenge, or opportunity emerges during Discovery but lacks detail, don’t guess—assign an Assessment. This could be a standardized technology stack review, a cybersecurity scan, or a digital maturity questionnaire, tailored to the specific topic. Assessments bring structure, evidence, and focus to vague or complex ideas.? Update and refine your Business Goals, Topics, and Initiatives.  Once Assessments are complete, review the results and adjust the original goals, topics and initiatives. This step ensures that every initiative is rooted in verified data and that business priorities are clearly defined.? Validate with the client during your Annual Strategic Meeting. Present the refined Business Goals, Topics, and Initiatives to your client for confirmation. Walk through each one, invite feedback, and clarify anything that’s ambiguous or off-target. This collaborative review builds alignment and accountability.? Translate structured goals into deliverables. Once the client confirms their goals and priorities, convert them into actionable deliverables—roadmaps, playbooks, project scopes, or initiative lists. These become the backbone of your Customer Success plan, turning strategy into day-to-day action.

CS Strategy - Ultimate Guide
Designing a Role-Aligned Operating System for Customer Success DeliveryAuthor: ScalePad Strategy OfficeContributor: Joe Markert, Director of CS ResearchAbstractAs MSPs evolve from reactive technical support to proactive, strategic partners, role clarity has become a critical success factor. This paper introduces the Four Quadrants of MSP Roles, a practical framework designed to structure Customer Success teams by two strategic axes: Business vs. Technology Impact and Operational vs. Strategic Engagement. By adopting this model, MSPs can reduce delivery friction, clarify responsibilities, and improve client outcomes across the maturity spectrum.IntroductionMost MSPs experience growing pains as their services diversify. Technical delivery becomes intertwined with account strategy, client expectations evolve, and internal teams struggle with handoffs, duplication, and gaps in ownership. Clients ask:“Who owns our roadmap? Who’s my main contact? Why does this keep falling through the cracks?”The Four Quadrants of MSP Roles framework solves this by mapping roles not only to job titles—but to types of value delivered.The ModelThe quadrant model is built on two intersecting axes:? Vertical Axis (Y): Impact Orientation — from Technology to Business? Horizontal Axis (X): Engagement Type — from Operational to StrategicThis results in four functional quadrants:1. Technology Operations FocusRoles: TAM, SDM, NOC, SOCImpact Orientation: TechnologyEngagement Style: OperationalKey Functions:? Service delivery execution? Cybersecurity configuration and maintenance? Backup and disaster recovery alignment? Process and best practice implementationThese roles ensure technical reliability and compliance with defined standards.2. Strategic Technology FocusRoles: vCIO, vCISO, PMImpact Orientation: TechnologyEngagement Style: StrategicKey Functions:? Building and owning the technology roadmap?

Course #1: MRR-Based TouchpointsSubtitle: Rethink How You Allocate CS Time — Strategically, Not EmotionallyOriginal ProblemMost MSPs allocate Customer Success time based on habit, intuition, or relationship pressure, not financial or strategic logic. But the real issue isn’t time allocation — it’s segmentation that ignores strategic readiness. MSPs often segment by MRR alone, leading to blind spots where high-potential clients are underserved and low-potential clients are over-supported.PurposeTo build a dual-axis segmentation framework that balances economic prioritization (MRR) with strategic readiness (Client Business Goal = Maturity + Appetite), so CS time is allocated based on both value and potential.This course reframes how MSPs define CS service levels — not by gut feel or legacy assumptions, but through financial alignment using Monthly Recurring Revenue and goal-level segmentation.Learning Objectives? Segment clients using Primary (Client Business Goal) and Secondary (MRR banding) segmentation.? Define proactive vs. reactive service levels by client type? Allocate touch frequency and format based on both economic tier and strategic intent, not just size alone.Core Content Outline1. The Fallacy of Flat CS Delivery? Why “same QBR for everyone” failsi. Different Client Goals require different engagement styles, roles, and cadences. Segment D (Goal 1) needs stability and visibility, while Segment A (Goals 4–5) expects strategic co-planning.ii. Over-servicing Sustain clients vs. ignoring Transform clientsiii. Client readiness (Maturity + Appetite) should be the primary segmentation input. MRR only defines how much, not what.? Over-servicing Sustain clients vs. ignoring Transform ones2. Segmentation Inputs? Combine MRR with Appetite/Maturity segmentation? Primary Segmentation: Client Business Goal level (based on Maturity + Appetite scores)? Secondary Segmentation: MRR band (VIP, High, Mid, Low)? Define engagement tiers based on both:i. Segment A ? Strategic planningii. Segment B ? Formalized insight + roadmapiii. Segment C ? Structured enablementiv. Segment D ? Operational consistency? MRR Bands:i. VIP: $10,000+ii. High Touch: $5,000–$10,000iii. Mid Touch: $1,500–$5,000iv. Low Touch: <$1,5003. Touchpoint Design? Introduce the Four-Touch Model based on both Frequency ? Depth and Strategic Readiness:i. VIP Touch ? Weekly or Biweekly, led by vCxO/Strategic Advisorsii. High Touch ? Monthly, playbook-driveniii. Mid Touch ? Quarterly QBRs or async updatesiv. Tech Touch ? Trigger-based (CS Health alerts, reports)? Use the Client Goal segment to define the type of content (what kind of conversation) and the MRR tier to define the cadence (how often).? Also define delivery mode: Virtual, In-person, Async.Practice ExerciseTitle: CS Segmentation & Touchpoint Mapping Sprint Steps:? List all clients with MRR? Score each client’s Maturity and Appetite (1–5)? Plot each on the Client Goal quadrant (Segment A–D)? Assign MRR Band? Define per client:? Segment (A–D) and MRR Band? Touch frequency? Meeting types (Strategic, Tactical, QBR, Check-in)? Roles (AM, vCIO, etc.)ToolkitsCS Tool 4 – Segmentation & Playbook Supports both strategic and financial segmentation through:1. Primary Segmentation – Plot clients on the Maturity ? Appetite matrix2. Secondary Segmentation – Sort clients by MRR and assign Band (VIP–Low)3. Touchpoint Logic – Define cadence and format based on segment + MRRSegment Thresholds:? VIP: $10,000+? High Touch: $5,000–$10,000? Mid Touch: $1,500–$5,000? Low Touch: <$1,500This method ensures delivery aligns with financial scale and strategic potential.
Course #2: Set Engagement Time Budgets Based on Financial ConstraintsSubtitle: Design Your CS Model with Real Margins in MindOriginal ProblemMany MSPs treat Customer Success delivery as unlimited, offering engagement without constraints, leading to margin erosion and burnout. The deeper issue is the lack of a structured Engagement Strategy (7.2) that links available time to Client Segments, roles, and cadence. Without this, CS work becomes reactive and disconnected from financial reality. A scalable CS model begins with a clear understanding of what you can spend, where, and why.PurposeTo establish a financially viable and segment-aligned Engagement Strategy by translating revenue, cost, and strategic intent into time budgets that support both structured engagements (e.g., playbooks) and operational realities.Learning ObjectivesBy the end of this course, participants will be able to:? Define a CS Engagement Strategy that determines per-client CS investment? Calculate total available CS hours using revenue, cost, and margin? Split time into Proactive and Reactive buckets based on service style? Align delivery effort to client segments, MRR tiers, and business goalsCore Content Outline1. Engagement Strategy - Choose a CS Engagement Strategy based on how you intend to serve clients:? Boutique – 9% of MRR allocated to CS? Premium – 7% of MRR? Standard – 5% of MRR? Value – 3% of MRR? Cost Driver – 1% of MRRThis maps to the CS Engagement Strategy. Boutique providers invest more time in deeper relationships. Cost Driver MSPs optimize for minimal service load. The engagement strategy defines your CS operating model.2. Hourly Cost? Estimate your average hourly cost for Customer Success delivery.? Include loaded salary, tools, and operational overhead.? Weight the average across CS roles based on utilization.? This becomes your basis for time-budget planning and role capacity validation.3. Proactive vs. Reactive Effort - Determine the percentage of CS effort that should be proactively planned (e.g., QBRs, onboarding, playbooks) versus reactive support (e.g., urgent client needs, escalations, unplanned project scope work). We recommend:? Proactive: Roadmaps, onboarding, reviews, check-ins, quarterly themes? Reactive: At-risk clients, escalations, unscheduled planning and resolution The split ensures you retain capacity for strategic impact without dropping unplanned events.4. Time Budget Model - For each client tier (VIP, High Touch, Mid Touch, Low Touch), calculate:? Monthly CS Budget = MRR ? Engagement Strategy %? Total Hours = Monthly Budget ÷ Hourly Cost? Split time into Proactive and Reactive       Example: $5,000 MRR ? 5% = $250 per month budget. At $100 per hour, this client receives 2.5 hours of CS time. If 70% is proactive and 30% is reactive, that’s 1.75 hours strategic and 0.75 hours buffer. This builds a repeatable, financially aligned delivery model.Practice ExerciseTitle: Time Budget Modeller? Select your Engagement Strategy? Enter the average Hourly Cost? Define desired Proactive vs. Reactive % split? Input average MRR per client by tier? Calculate the CS Budget per client? Divide by the Hourly Cost to get the available time? Split by Proactive and Reactive, and map each result to the segment-based Playbook cadence? Identify over- or under-engagement by comparing delivery targets to actual capacity.ToolkitsCS Tool 4 – Segmentation & Playbook Supports CS time budgeting through four integrated planning tools:1. Engagement Strategy Selector – Enables MSPs to determine the percentage of their recurring revenue to allocate to CS activities, ranging from 1% (lean model) to 9% (high-touch strategy).2. Effort Split Planner – Helps structure the proportion of proactive versus reactive CS time, aligning delivery style with business risk and client expectations.3. Hourly Cost Estimator – Calculates the average blended hourly cost of CS team members based on their salary, role utilization, and indirect overhead.4. Capacity Planning Engine – Maps time investment to cadence and feasibility of Playbook execution.Why This Matters: Without a grounded time model, the Engagement Strategy fails. And without time for Playbook delivery, strategic engagements collapse. This course ensures that what you plan can be delivered at scale, with measurable outcomes and team alignment.
Course #3: Match Team Capabilities to Activities in ArchetypesSubtitle: Prove That Strategic CS Isn’t Just Nice — It’s NecessaryOriginal ProblemMany MSPs design proactive CS playbooks without verifying whether their team has the capabilities to deliver them. Strategic roadmaps and vertical-specific initiatives often fall short because internal skills don’t align with client needs. Without a method to align team strengths with client archetypes and delivery plans, MSPs overcommit and underperform, losing credibility and wasting CS effort.PurposeThis course shows MSPs how to tie proactive CS activities to real business value — and to their delivery capabilities. It introduces a framework to map CS work to Business Capabilities, Business Opportunities, and Vertical Competency — helping leaders prioritize what matters, cut the noise, and assign the right people to the right playbooks.Learning ObjectivesBy the end of this course, participants will be able to:? Identify proactive CS activities that drive business outcomes? Map those activities to specific business capabilities and opportunities? Align efforts with vertical-specific pain points for more resonant deliveryCore Content Outline1. What Makes CS “Proactive”? Activities that anticipate need, reduce risk, or create growth. CS ≠ Relationship Management — it’s value engineerin.g2. The Business Value Lens - Three Value Drivers:? Revenue – Enablement, Efficiency? Risk – Compliance, Security? Cost – Waste Reduction, Standardization3. Proactive Activity Mapping? Roadmaps ? Risk Mitigation & Innovation? Strategic Budgeting ? Financial Control? Lifecycle Refresh ? Operational Efficiency4. Vertical Alignment Framework - Map CS activities to specific vertical needs:? Healthcare = Compliance? Manufacturing = Uptime? Professional Services = Billable TimeExtend mapping using three capability categories:? Business Capabilities – Application Selection, Data & BI Expertise, CRM Proficiency? Business Opportunities – Remote Workforce Enablement, Internet of Things (IoT), Process Automation? Vertical Competency – Retail, Legal, Manufacturing, HealthcareThese dimensions ensure proactive CS activities are both high-value and deliverable by your team.Practice ExerciseTitle: CS Activity Value Grid? Select your top 5 proactive CS activities? For each:? Map to a value driver (Revenue, Risk, Cost)? Tie to a business capability (e.g., secure remote work)? Identify 1–2 verticals that it most supports? Score each activity:? Impact potential? Ease of execution? Relevance to your book of businessToolkitsCS Tool 4 – Segmentation & Playbook This tool supports proactive CS delivery planning by connecting team capability data to a structured, math-based Playbook Planning model. Rather than using AI to generate outcomes, the logic is based on matching three internal inputs:1. Business Capabilities (e.g., CRM, Application Selection, Data/BI Expertise)2. Business Opportunities (e.g., Remote Workforce Enablement, IoT, Resilience Planning)3. Vertical Competency (e.g., Legal, Manufacturing, Retail, Healthcare)Each team member or CS role can be assigned coverage across these three axes. Based on this input, the tool cross-references delivery expectations for each client segment (VIP, High Touch, Mid Touch, Low Touch) and cadence level (Annual, Quarterly, Monthly, Ad-Hoc).The result is a Playbook Planning matrix that assigns specific deliverables to the roles or team members best suited to handle them. For example:? VIP clients may require strategic planning around cloud migration, cybersecurity initiatives, and digital transformation frameworks, aligned with roles that possess strong Business Capabilities in platform design and Business Opportunities in G-SMART/AI enablement.? Mid Touch clients may need monthly check-ins, cloud usage reviews, and lightweight risk assessments — assigned to generalists with moderate vertical knowledge and core service fluency.? Low-touch segments are mapped to operational responders who can cover standard system reviews, incident resolution, and alert follow-ups, without requiring deep strategic input.This planning table is not generic — it is customized to each MSP based on their unique delivery structure, segmentation model, and team capability profile. It ensures every proactive CS deliverable is matched to someone with the skill, capacity, and context to execute it reliably.By the end of the planning process, leaders receive a full matrix showing:? What needs to be delivered (topics, meetings, cadence)? Who is best equipped to deliver it? Where there are gaps in coverage that require upskilling or role sharingThis output directly supports the execution of the Engagement Strategy and ensures that the right playbooks are delivered to the right clients, by the right roles, at the right time.
Course #4: CS Team Blueprint – Who, How Many Hours, RoleSubtitle: Build a Team That Matches the Strategy You Just DesignedOriginal ProblemMany MSPs build their CS teams reactively — assigning roles to people rather than aligning people to work. They lack visibility into how many hours their current team can deliver compared to the actual hours needed based on segmentation and playbook plans. This leads to burnout, inconsistent delivery, and strategic underperformance. Without a capacity-based team design, growth in CS is impossible to scale or sustain.PurposeThis course helps CS leaders align their team structure to their segmentation model and delivery strategy. Using inputs from segmentation, time modelling, and cadence planning, it calculates the roles needed, the required hours, and the available team capacity — so you can design a team that can actually deliver the strategy.Learning ObjectivesBy the end of this course, participants will be able to:? Define the necessary CS roles (AM, TAM, vCIO, CSM) based on client segmentation? Allocate hours per role by client tier and activity type? Identify coverage gaps and team imbalance risksCore Content Outline1. From Strategy to Staffing? CS isn’t scalable until you staff to your segments? Don’t build roles for people — build roles for the work2. Role Planning by Segment? Match each segment (VIP, High, Mid, Low) with a delivery model? Determine resource type (Strategic vs. Operational CS roles)3. Time Budget by Role? How many clients per AM? vCIO? TAM?? How many hours per client per month per tier?4. Identify Team Model? Shared vs. Dedicated Roles? Solo vs. Paired Coverage? Strategic Specialists vs. Generalist Flex RolesPractice ExerciseTitle: Team Delivery Model Canvas Map each client segment to required roles (solo or paired) Assign:? Number of clients per role? Hours/month per client? Role(s) responsible? Calculate total hours per role? Compared to the current team structure? Highlight under- or over-capacity issuesToolkitsCS Tool 4 – Segmentation & Playbook This toolkit supports capacity-based CS team design through three key inputs and one structured output:1. People & Roles Inventory – The user defines their CS team members, roles, and whether they are full-time or part-time contributors to CS work (e.g., 50% allocation = 1000 hours/year if 2000 hours is full-time).2. Client Portfolio Composition – The number of clients per segment (VIP, High Touch, Mid Touch, Low Touch) is entered.3. Capacity Planning Reference – Based on the previously defined playbook delivery cadence (from Course 2), the system calculates the required hours per client, per segment, and year.These inputs are used to generate a Capacity Overview, which includes:? CS Hours Required per Segment (e.g., VIP: 450 hours, High Touch: 810 hours…)? CS Hours Required per Cadence (Annual, Quarterly, Monthly, Ad-Hoc)? Total Required CS Hours per Year? Total FTEs Needed, assuming 1 FTE = 2000 hours? Current Team Capacity, based on declared % allocations? Capacity Gap, calculated by subtracting the current supply from the required hoursSample Capacity Overview Insight (Narrative Style): Based on your current delivery plan, your team requires 2330 hours per year to cover all CS activities across your VIP, High Touch, Mid Touch, and Low Touch clients. These hours are distributed across various cadences, with the majority consumed by Ad-Hoc and Monthly engagements. Your current team, composed of two partially allocated resources, provides only 1,200 hours annually, covering just over 50% of the requirement. This creates a shortfall of ~1,130 hours or 1.14 full-time equivalents (FTEs).Recommendations Example:? Increase Capacity – Add 1–2 full-time employees (FTEs) focused on proactive work for VIP and High-Touch clients. These segments drive the most strategic value and therefore deserve experienced customer service (CS) coverage.? Ramp Up Strategically – Prioritize capacity improvements for Annual and Quarterly activities in high-impact segments first, while deferring lower-impact cadences in mid- and low-segment activities.? Automate or Delegate – Utilize automation or internal admin support to absorb routine or Ad-Hoc workload for Low-Touch clients. This frees up strategic CS time without sacrificing responsiveness.This capacity-based role planning ensures that your CS Engagement Strategy and Playbook delivery model are grounded in realistic execution, sustainable staffing, and segment-aligned delivery rhythm.
Course #5: CS Strategy, Capability & Capacity GapSubtitle: Turn Your Insights Into a Minimum Viable Plan You Can ExecuteOriginal ProblemMost MSPs never achieve a functional CS strategy — either because they over-engineer it or fail to commit to a version 1.0. They collect data but don’t synthesize it. As a result, teams remain misaligned, service remains reactive, and strategic goals stall. Without a plan that reflects current capacity, actual client needs, and team capabilities, CS remains stuck in theory.PurposeThis course helps CS leaders consolidate all insights from Segmentation, Time Budgeting, Capability Mapping, and Team Design into a Minimum Viable CS Strategy. The goal is to create a documented, operational strategy — one that includes clear playbooks, aligned vision, realistic capacity limits, and prioritized strategic initiatives.Learning ObjectivesBy the end of this course, participants will be able to:? Define your CS strategic priorities across people, process, and impact? Identify key capability and resource gaps blocking CS success? Draft a Minimum Viable CS Strategy Document with timelines and ownersCore Content Outline1. Why Most CS Strategies Fail Too long, too abstract, too dependent on one person You need version 1.0 that’s shippable and evolves fast2. The MVP Strategy Framework Includes the following core components:? Segmentation? Time Budgets? Roles + Delivery Model? Strategic CS Activities? Governance Cadence + KPIsGaps to address:? People: capacity, specialization, burnout? Process: playbook triggers, follow-up consistency? Platform: automation, reporting, client-facing artifacts3. From Insight to Action Plan Use inputs from prior courses to:? Generate Playbook SOPs for every segment & cadence? Analyze SWOT based on client mix, resource constraints, and delivery capacity? Define CS Vision and Mission that match the MSP’s strategy? Prioritize the top 3–5 strategic initiatives to close the gapPractice ExerciseTitle: Build Your MVP CS Strategy Review all outputs from Courses 1–4:? Playbook Planning? Capacity Planning? Capacity Overview? Capability MapComplete the MVP CS Strategy Template with:? Vision Statement? Mission Statement? Strategic Priorities? Segment Strategy? Delivery Model? SWOT Analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats)? Identified Capability Gaps? Planning SOP Framework? 3–5 Strategic Initiatives? Next Milestone (90 days)? Ownership & timelinesToolkitsCS Tool 4 – Segmentation & Playbook This tool supports final strategy creation through four key automation layers:1. Planning SOP Generator - Takes outputs from Playbook Planning (Course 3) and Capacity Planning (Course 2) to auto-generate a multi-tiered set of Planning Standard Operating Procedures for each segment and cadence (Annual, Quarterly, Monthly, Ad-Hoc). Each SOP includes:? Trigger condition? Prep tools required? Assigned accountable? Estimated hours per step? Meeting content & follow-up tasks? Deliverables per playbook This structure is generated mathematically based on segment-specific effort levels, tools in use, and cadence frequency, not AI improvisation.2. Vision & Mission Creator - Uses your MSP’s positioning, client mix, and strategic intent to produce a CS Vision and CS Mission statement that anchors the team’s purpose. The tone reflects your Engagement Strategy (e.g., Premium, Boutique) and the complexity of your client base.3. SWOT Engine - Analyzes internal data (client mix, capacity gaps, capability mapping) and provides a simple SWOT analysis:? Strengths (e.g., experienced vCIOs, loyal clients)? Weaknesses (e.g., low coverage in Mid Touch)? Opportunities (e.g., playbook expansion in verticals)? Threats (e.g., over-servicing Low Touch, no CS KPIs)4. Strategic Initiative Planner - Takes identified gaps and builds 3–5 focused CS initiatives (e.g., “Launch Client Discovery SOPs in High Touch,” “Automate Monthly Reports for Mid Touch”), assigning owners, resources, and deadlines — tied to capacity feasibility and business value.This full-stack planning capability enables MSPs to develop not just a CS strategy, but a strategy that can actually be implemented.

Why Your CS Strategy Might Be Failing3 Warning Signs:? You keep promising QBRs… but only deliver once a year? CEOs stop showing up—clients delegate the meetings down? You can’t delegate or scale—CS lives in the owner’s headWhat’s Actually Broken:? You haven’t defined how much time you can give each client ? Capacity? You haven’t defined what to deliver to each client ? Capability? You haven’t aligned your team to the work needed ? BalanceHere’s Your Fix: The CS Strategy CanvasThis tool helps you define:? Your CS Capacity (time, effort, investment)? Your CS Capability (what value you can actually deliver)? And your CS Balance (how to align your team to do it consistently)? Simple. ? Visual. ? Realistic. Let’s build a strategy you can actually execute.
App Cover PageMost MSPs struggle to scale Customer Success because they don’t have a clear strategy for matching effort to value. You might be over-servicing small clients or under-delivering to your best ones, not because of intent, but because there’s no system. To fix this, we need to answer four critical questions:1. How much revenue do we generate from each client segment?2. How much time can we realistically allocate to each segment based on that revenue?3. What types of high-value engagements are appropriate and deliverable for each segment?4. And critically, do we even have enough resources to support all segments, or are we overcommitted without knowing it?The CS Strategy Builder walks you through each of these questions. By the end, you’ll have a capacity-aware, value-aligned strategy that defines who gets what, and ensures your team can deliver it.
Step 1: Auto-Enrich Your Strategy FoundationsOn this page, you simply provide your MSP’s website address. Our tool will automatically scan your website to gather key company information, such as your company profile, vision, mission, vertical focus, and any strategic messaging you share publicly. This enriched data will be woven into your final Customer Success Strategy to make it more tailored, credible, and professional.Why is this step important?? Personalization: By pulling in real company language and positioning, the resulting strategy and outputs (e.g., vision, mission, SWOT) feel authentic and aligned with how you already describe your business, both internally and to clients.? Corporate Strategy Integration: If your MSP’s corporate vision, mission, and SWOT can be extracted from the website, then the entire CS Strategy can be tuned to fit these elements. When your CS plan and vision are aligned to your organization’s top-level strategy, your team will buy in more easily and execute with confidence. You avoid a “bolt-on” feeling and instead build a plan that both staff and leadership can support.? Better Insights: Public messaging about your capabilities, market position, and vertical expertise can enrich your strategy, highlight differentiators, and identify potential growth areas or gaps.How does the tool use this data?? Strategic Alignment: Extracted vision and mission statements will guide the tone and priorities of your Customer Success plan.? SWOT Analysis Support: Public claims (e.g., “specialists in financial compliance”) help auto-fill strengths or identify gaps for the weaknesses and opportunities sections. If the website provides relevant vision, mission, or even SWOT-style statements, those will be pre-loaded and used as a starting point for your CS outputs.? CS Messaging: Press-ready language and company values are integrated into your final Customer Success vision/mission outputs.What if your website doesn’t have all the needed information?? No Problem: You can review and edit any auto-extracted content during the strategy wizard. If the site does not include vision, mission, or SWOT, you’ll be prompted later in a dedicated review step to supply or adjust these directly—before finalizing your CS Strategy. This ensures that, regardless of data availability, you can always align the CS vision and mission to your organization's top-level strategy in the final step.How can you improve data accuracy?? Be ready to review: If your website does not include a clear vision, mission, or SWOT statement, consider preparing these elements before starting the wizard. This will help you ensure that the Customer Success vision, mission, and SWOT are well aligned with your actual company strategy as you move through the later steps of the tool. The more complete and accurate your inputs, the better your final Customer Success Strategy will reflect your real business.Example: What the Tool Might ExtractIf your website homepage says: “At BluePeak MSP, we’re the trusted technology partner for education, specializing in compliance, classroom collaboration, and digital transformation.”? Strength (SWOT): Deep expertise in education sector compliance and collaboration.? Vision/Mission: “Our vision is to empower educational institutions with secure, future-proof technology that advances learning outcomes.” “Our mission is to deliver proactive, partnership-driven Customer Success for every school daily.”If the site is sparse, you can fill these out during the wizard.
CS TouchpointsCustomer Touchpoints represent the moments and ways your MSP interacts with clients, tailored to their strategic value and revenue contribution. Capturing and analyzing revenue by client segment provides critical insight into where your Customer Success efforts should focus. MSPs risk misallocating resources without understanding how much revenue comes from each segment, over-servicing low-value accounts while under-serving their most strategic clients.Accurate segmentation by Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) bands allows you to define distinct client engagement levels—from high-touch, strategic partnerships to light-touch, automated check-ins. This segmentation forms the foundation for sustainable Customer Success operations by aligning service depth with economic impact.
Step 2: Segment Your Clients by MRR BandsCustomer Touchpoints represent the moments and ways your MSP interacts with clients, tailored to their strategic value and revenue contribution. Capturing and analyzing revenue by client segment provides critical insight into where your Customer Success efforts should focus. MSPs risk misallocating resources without understanding how much revenue comes from each segment, over-servicing low-value accounts while under-serving their most strategic clients.What are Client Segments Based on MRR Bands?While this tool currently supports segmentation primarily by MRR to help MSPs prioritize Customer Success resources based on financial impact, the most robust segmentation models combine MRR with strategic readiness—meaning client maturity and appetite. We recommend using MRR as a starting point, but over time, layering in maturity and appetite data for more precise, value-driven engagement The most common segmentation model divides clients into four tiers:? Segment A — VIP Touch: Clients generate $10,000+ MRR, requiring frequent strategic engagement and executive involvement.? Segment B — High Touch: Clients generate $5,000–$10,000 MRR and receive regular, formal cadence and advisory sessions.? Segment C — Mid Touch: Clients generating $2,500–$5,000 MRR, managed with quarterly reviews and tactical check-ins.Segment D — Light Touch: Clients generating below $2,500 MRR, typically served with automated or ad hoc communications.Why is this segmentation important?? It ensures that your highest-value clients receive the time and strategic focus they require.? It prevents unnecessary over-investment in clients whose revenue or appetite doesn’t justify it.? It helps set internal and client expectations about service levels and engagement frequency.How should you assign segments?? Use actual MRR data from your billing or CRM systems.? Sort clients by MRR and divide into bands representing roughly equal portions of total revenue, not just client counts.? Align engagement strategies and Customer Success efforts according to segment assignments.What if your segmentation needs adjustment?? If you are over-serving low-value clients, consider shifting your segment boundaries upward, meaning fewer clients qualify as high-touch.? Conversely, if too many clients fall into high-touch segments and your team is overwhelmed, you may need to move clients to lower-touch segments to maintain sustainable service.? Use Health metrics such as Engagement, Adoption, and Alignment scores to refine segmentation decisions over time.How can you improve segmentation accuracy?? Regularly review and update your segment assignments at least quarterly.? As your data maturity improves, begin incorporating health signals and business goal readiness (maturity/appetite) in addition to pure MRR to refine segmentation.? Use feedback from both your team and clients to validate that each segment receives the right level of service.? If your CRM or PSA allows, automate updates to keep segmentation accurate as clients grow, shrink, or change focus.
CS CapabilitiesBuilding a scalable and effective Customer Success operation requires deeply understanding your team's capabilities and how they align with your client portfolio. The CS Capabilities block focuses on three essential dimensions that determine your ability to deliver consistent, high-value outcomes:? Engagement Strategy: How you segment clients by revenue bands and allocate your Customer Success investment accordingly. This ensures your highest-value clients receive appropriate attention while lower-tier clients are efficiently managed.? Hourly Cost: The fully loaded cost of your Customer Success resources, including salaries, benefits, overhead, and other indirect expenses. Knowing this cost is crucial to translating budget into actionable time capacity and realistic staffing plans.? Proactive Effort: The balance between planned, strategic Customer Success activities (quarterly business reviews, roadmap sessions, and budgeting meetings) and reactive, ad hoc client support or escalations. Managing this balance is critical to driving forward-looking value while handling day-to-day client needs.Without clear insight into these three areas, MSPs risk misallocating resources—over-servicing small accounts while under-serving high-potential clients. This imbalance can lead to burnout, inconsistent client experiences, and ultimately lost growth opportunities. MSPs build a sustainable and scalable Customer Success engine by quantifying engagement investment, understanding real resource costs, and managing proactive vs. reactive efforts.This capability framework supports internal resource planning and helps MSP leadership make data-driven decisions about segmentation, playbook design, and staffing. It links financial inputs to strategic outputs, enabling MSPs to confidently scale Customer Success without sacrificing quality or relevance.
Step 3: Define Your Engagement Investment ModelEngagement Strategy: How you segment clients by revenue bands and allocate your Customer Success investment accordingly. This ensures your highest-value clients receive appropriate attention while lower-tier clients are efficiently managed.Hourly Cost: The fully loaded cost of your Customer Success resources, including salaries, benefits, overhead, and other indirect expenses. Knowing this cost is crucial to translating budget into actionable time capacity and realistic staffing plans.Proactive Effort: The balance between planned, strategic Customer Success activities (quarterly business reviews, roadmap sessions, and budgeting meetings) and reactive, ad hoc client support or escalations. Managing this balance is critical to driving forward-looking value while handling day-to-day client needs.
Engagement StrategyWhat is an Engagement Strategy and Why Does it Matter?Your Engagement Strategy sets the level of Customer Success investment you’re willing to make for each client segment. This isn’t just a number—it’s a commitment to how much time, effort, and expertise you’ll dedicate to driving value for your clients. The Engagement Strategy defines the bandwidth for strategic meetings, roadmap sessions, proactive playbooks, and more.A clear, realistic Engagement Strategy ensures that your most valuable clients receive high-touch, strategic guidance, while your mid- and lower-tier segments are managed with efficient, scalable processes. It is the bridge between your financial planning and the actual client experience.Why is Choosing the Right Engagement Level Important?Setting your engagement level too high leads to overpromising and team burnout; too low, and you risk underdelivering to key accounts and missing growth opportunities. The right Engagement Strategy makes your Customer Success effort:? Predictable: You know exactly how much resource you’re allocating per segment.? Scalable: You avoid spreading your team too thin as you grow.? Strategic: You deliver the right engagement rhythm for each client’s value and potential.What Engagement Investment Levels Should You Consider?Most MSPs adopt one of five standard models:? Boutique – 9%: Deep, white-glove engagement for VIP clients. (Frequent executive sessions, heavy vCIO/CSM involvement, detailed planning.)? Premium – 7%: High-touch, regular strategy and roadmap reviews for your top growth clients.? Standard – 5%: Balanced, structured engagement for your core client base—quarterly meetings, periodic playbooks, roadmap and budget sessions.? Value – 3%: Lean engagement, with semi-annual reviews and playbooks, mostly virtual.? Cost Driver – 1%: Tech-touch or automation-driven engagement, triggered only by issues or annual reviews.Choose the investment level that fits each segment, based on their MRR, strategic importance, and maturity.How Do You Assign the Engagement Model to Segments?? Start with Segmentation: Use your client segments (A, B, C, D or VIP, High Touch, Mid Touch, Tech Touch) as defined by MRR bands and strategic fit.? Match Investment to Segment: Assign higher engagement models (e.g., Boutique, Premium) to your highest-value or highest-potential segments. Assign Value or Cost Driver to your smallest, least strategic segments.? Document Your Choices: For each segment, record the % of MRR to be reinvested as Customer Success effort.Example Table:SegmentTypical MRREngagement Model% CS InvestmentNotesSegment A$10,000+Boutique9%Executive sponsor, monthlySegment B$5,000+Premium7%vCIO/CSM, quarterlySegment C$2,500+Standard5%TAM/AM, quarterly/virtualSegment D$0+Value/Cost Driver3%/1%Tech touch, annual/reportsHow Do You Use These Percentages in Planning?? Calculate the Annual CS Budget: Multiply the chosen % by the client’s annual MRR.? Convert to Time: Divide the CS budget by your hourly cost to find how many hours you can realistically dedicate.? Set Cadence: Decide what meetings, playbooks, or touchpoints fit within this time.? Assign Roles: Ensure that the right CS roles (e.g., vCIO, CSM, TAM) are aligned to segments based on the engagement level.What if Your Engagement Model Doesn’t Work in Practice?If you find you’re consistently overspending time, or struggling to meet commitments:? Revisit Investment Levels: Reduce engagement percentages for lower-value segments.? Shift Segment Boundaries: Move more clients into lower-touch segments.? Automate Lower-Tier Engagements: Use digital reports, videos, or automated QBRs.? Prioritize Strategic Accounts: Reserve the highest engagement only for clients where it truly drives retention and growth.
—Hourly CostWhat Is the Hourly Cost and Why Is It Important?The hourly cost is the actual, all-in cost of delivering Customer Success work, including salary, benefits, overhead, technology, training, and management. This figure is critical: it translates your strategic intent (e.g., “we’ll spend 5% of MRR on CS”) into realistic, budgeted hours that your team can actually deliver.Knowing your hourly rate allows you to plan, price, and scale Customer Success sustainably—so you avoid overcommitting resources, underestimating CS spend, or undervaluing your most important client relationships.Why Does Accurate Cost Calculation Matter?? Budget Realism: You can’t allocate hours you can’t afford—knowing your real cost protects margins and prevents staff overload.? Staffing Decisions: If your average CS hourly rate is $80, you’ll know exactly how many hours each CS team member can deliver per year, and how many FTEs you’ll need as you grow.? Transparent Planning: With a clear hourly cost, every segment, engagement plan, and playbook cadence can be mapped to a tangible delivery plan.How Should You Calculate the Hourly Rate?? Include All Costs: Add up gross salary, benefits (healthcare, taxes, PTO), software and tooling, training, and a portion of management/overhead.? Calculate Total Available Hours: Typically, 1 FTE = 1,680–1,800 hours/year, but only 60–75% is available for client-facing CS (the rest is admin, meetings, internal work).? Divide Total Cost by Available Hours: This gives you a realistic, loaded hourly cost for CS delivery.Example Calculation:? Salary + Benefits + Overhead per CS FTE: $120,000/year? Available client-facing hours: 1,500? Hourly Rate: $120,000 ÷ 1,500 = $80/hourYou can select from typical benchmarks:? $60/hour (lean team, minimal overhead)? $80/hour (average MSP, some specialization)? $100/hour (specialized CS roles, high-touch segments)How to Use the Hourly Cost in Practice?? Calculate Hours Per Client: Annual CS budget for each client ÷ hourly cost = number of hours you can allocate to that client.? Set Delivery Expectations: If you promise quarterly QBRs and roadmap sessions, check if your budgeted hours can cover that level of engagement.? Plan Staffing: Sum up hours across all clients and segments; divide by each FTE’s available hours to see how many CS team members you’ll need.Example Table:SegmentAnnual CS BudgetHourly RateHours AvailableSegment A$9,000$10090Segment B$4,500$9050Segment C$3,000$7540Segment D$1,500$7520What if Costs Are Too High or Too Low?? If your real cost is higher than planned, reduce engagement intensity, automate lower-tier interactions, or adjust your CS investment levels.? If costs are low, check if you’re underinvesting in critical roles or missing opportunities for strategic impact.How Can You Improve Cost Accuracy Over Time?? Track Real-Time: Use timesheets or time-tracking to monitor real CS hours per client and compare to the plan.? Recalculate Annually: Update your loaded rate as salaries, tooling, or benefits change.? Adjust for Specialization: For advanced CS roles (vCIO, BI/AI, regulatory), use a blended or premium rate as needed.By setting a transparent, realistic hourly cost for Customer Success, you can connect your strategic plan to operational reality, ensuring every hour and dollar is well spent.
—-Proactive EffortWhy Is the Proactive/Reactive Split Critical?The proactive/reactive split defines how much of your Customer Success time is invested in planned, strategic activities (like annual planning, QBRs, roadmap sessions, and playbooks) versus unplanned, reactive work (like incident response, last-minute escalations, ad-hoc meetings, or client “firefighting”).A sustainable CS program isn’t just about doing “more”—it’s about doing the right things at the right time. The ideal ratio (e.g., 60% proactive / 40% reactive) keeps your team out of firefighting mode and ensures you have enough bandwidth for real client impact.Why Does This Balance Matter?? Client Experience: Proactive CS drives trust, alignment, and strategic results—reactive CS is necessary but can dominate if not managed.? Team Wellbeing: Too much reactive work leads to burnout, errors, and missed strategic opportunities.? Growth & Retention: Planned, proactive engagements (QBRs, roadmap reviews, playbooks) are the strongest drivers of upsell, retention, and client advocacy.How Should You Set Your Proactive/Reactive Ratio?? Benchmark Typical Split: Most high-performing MSPs aim for 60–80% of CS time on proactive, planned work (e.g., annual, quarterly, monthly playbooks).? Start with 60/40: As a baseline, allocate 60% of CS hours to proactive engagements and 40% to reactive/ad-hoc work.? Adjust by Segment: VIP and High Touch clients get a higher proactive ratio; low-touch or tech-touch segments may need more reactive coverage.How Do You Track and Allocate This Effort?? Define Planned Activities: List all recurring playbooks and strategic engagements (annual reviews, QBRs, roadmap, budgeting, executive check-ins).? Track Ad-Hoc Time: Use time-tracking to log unplanned requests, escalations, or support-driven meetings.? Review Regularly: Compare planned vs. actual effort quarterly to stay on track.Example Table:SegmentAnnual CS HoursProactive %Proactive HoursReactive HoursSegment A10860%6543Segment B5460%3222Segment C2760%1611Segment D1860%117What if Your Proactive Time Is Too Low?? Automate Reactive Tasks: Use reporting, alerts, or self-service for basic requests.? Reduce Planned Touchpoints for Lower Segments: Focus effort where it has the greatest impact.? Coach Clients: Train clients to use structured CS engagements (like QBRs) instead of requesting ad-hoc calls.How Can You Improve the Proactive Ratio?? Batch Routine Work: Group similar client tasks into dedicated sessions.? Expand Playbook Usage: Use more templates and standardized agendas to reduce prep time.? Monitor and Adjust: Routinely revisit the ratio, especially if the team or client needs a shift.Step 4. CAPACITY Result PageThis page summarizes your Customer Success team’s available capacity across each client segment—VIP, High touch, Mid touch, and Low touch—based on your engagement strategy, hourly cost, and proactive planning ratio. For every segment, you’ll see a breakdown of annual, quarterly, monthly, and ad-hoc hours, plus the total planned CS time. Use this matrix to quickly identify if your available hours align with your client commitments and to spot any over- or under-allocation before you set playbook parameters. Adjust your strategy here to maintain balance between high-value engagement and team sustainability.
CS CapabilitiesThe CS Capabilities Block helps you map out the true power of your Customer Success organization. In this tool, all three—Vertical Competency, Growth Opportunities, and Business Capabilities—are considered together under the 'CS Capabilities' umbrella. Mapping these collectively ensures you can deliver, expand, and differentiate Customer Success in a unified, strategic way:1. Vertical Competency: What industries (verticals) do you truly understand—where your team knows the client’s data, workflows, compliance, and pain points?2. Growth Opportunities: What additional services can you cross-sell, up-sell, or expand into within your current client base, using a vendor-neutral service catalog?3. Business Capabilities: What can your team confidently deliver in front of the client, from strategic planning to financial management, assessments, and more?Defining these capabilities ensures you play to your strengths, know where you can stretch, and spot the most valuable opportunities for CS-driven growth. The goal: build a living map of what you do best, what you can grow into, and how you’ll support clients at every stage of maturity or industry focus.When you combine these three lenses, you get a practical “capabilities matrix” to match your team, services, and industry expertise to the evolving needs of your client portfolio. This is the bedrock for setting realistic CS strategy, staffing plans, and growth forecasts.
Step 5. Map Your Strategic CS CapabilitiesBusiness Capabilities: This is what your CS team can confidently deliver in front of a client: not just technical tasks, but business-facing skills like strategic planning, discovery workshops, budgeting, compliance reviews, etc.Growth Opportunities: A growth opportunity is any additional service—cross-sell, upsell, or expansion—you can offer to existing clients. It’s mapped to a standardized, vendor-neutral service catalog so you can track adoption and plan initiatives across the whole base.Vertical Competency: Vertical competency means your team has real-world expertise in a specific industry or sector (e.g., Education, Banking, Healthcare). It’s not just about having a few clients in the space—it’s about understanding the business model, workflows, compliance needs, and technology stack that matter for those clients.
Vertical CompetencyWhy is this important?? Clients want partners who "get" their world, not just generalists.? Deep industry understanding unlocks better discovery questions, more relevant playbooks, and credible recommendations.? It helps you differentiate your MSP—specialists win over generalists as CS matures.How should you assign verticals?? Review where you have multiple clients in a single industry.? Check your team's experience, certifications, or career history.? If you can confidently deliver business discovery, assessments, and roadmap planning in a vertical, select it.? Use the provided industry list for consistency.What data should you use?? Client portfolio data (industry codes, NAICS/SIC, etc. ???)? Internal skills/certification matrix? Project histories? CRM “vertical” or “industry” fieldsWhat if your first draft isn’t perfect?? Don’t worry if you only have one or two verticals now—mark what you’re best at today. You can expand over time as your team gains experience or you enter new markets.? Update the list as you win new clients or train up staff.How can you improve your vertical competency?? Invest in industry certifications for your team.? Assign vertical “champions” internally.? Build vertical-specific templates and playbooks as you learn.? Survey clients to find new verticals you’re naturally serving but haven’t formalized.
Growth OpportunitiesWhy is this important?? Most MSP growth comes from existing clients.? A mapped catalog makes CS expansion systematic, not random or sales-driven.? Enables playbook-driven upsell and strategic reviews (not just opportunistic pitching).How should you assign services?? Review the list of vendor-neutral services provided.? Mark every service you offer or want to grow into (even if you deliver it through a partner).? Add custom services if needed—the tool will match them in the background.What data should you use?? Your own service catalog/service item list? Project and ticket history (what have you already delivered)? CRM "products/services" modules? Annual client reviews and QBR notesWhat if your first draft isn’t perfect?? You can always adjust your list as you expand your offerings or sunset old ones.? Use the tool’s benchmarking to spot common gaps compared to your peers.How can you improve your growth mapping?? Regularly review new vendor-neutral service categories.? Ask your team what services clients are requesting most (but are missing).? Run “service adoption” reports and use them to fuel CS initiative proposals.
Business Capabilities Why is this important?? CS teams win when they’re seen as business advisors, not just project managers or IT support.? Capabilities define which playbooks you can deliver well—and which you may need to grow into or outsource.? A clear map prevents overpromising in QBRs and roadmaps.How should you assign capabilities?? Review the provided capability menu.? Mark what your team can deliver today (e.g., “Goal Setting & OKR Alignment,” “Vendor Management”).? If you have custom skills, add them—they’ll be matched for benchmarking.What data should you use?? Internal skills matrix? Client feedback on planning meetings, budgeting, or advisory sessions? Training/certification history? Service desk/project outcomesWhat if your first draft isn’t perfect?? That’s normal—mark your current state and revisit as you upskill or expand your team.? As you use more playbooks, you’ll see where your real strengths (or gaps) are.How can you improve business capabilities?? Invest in upskilling CS roles (e.g., CSMs learning budgeting, vCIOs learning compliance).? Pair junior CS staff with seasoned advisors for “shadow” playbook delivery.? Gather feedback from clients on which advisory skills made the biggest difference.
Step 6. Playbook Planning Result PageBased on your team’s selected CS Capabilities and client segmentation, this page displays your tailored Playbook Planning matrix. For each segment (VIP, High touch, Mid touch, Low touch), you’ll see recommended engagement types—Annual, Quarterly, Monthly, and Ad-Hoc—with specific examples of strategic, operational, and reactive touchpoints. These playbook guidelines ensure that every client receives the right level of proactive planning, issue resolution, and technology optimization in line with their business value and needs. You can use this matrix to fine-tune your engagement cadence and ensure scalable, repeatable Customer Success delivery across your portfolio.
CS BalanceThe CS Balance section brings your Customer Success Strategy together by mapping your internal team structure against your segmented client portfolio. This is where operational planning meets reality: you identify who on your team wears each CS “hat” (e.g., vCIO, TAM, CSM), and you match those resources against the number of clients in each segment. This alignment ensures you can deliver the promised level of engagement and playbook execution without overloading any individual or under-supporting any client.
Step 7: Balance Team Capacity and Client SegmentationIdentify which team members are responsible for each Customer Success role in your organization (e.g., vCIO, vCISO, TAM, AM, CSM) and estimate the percentage of their time dedicated to CS activities.Count how many clients fall into each CS segment (as defined in Step 1: Segment Your Clients by MRR Bands).Team MembersWhy is this important? Without clear role assignment and time allocation, it’s impossible to deliver consistent CS engagement at scale. This step prevents resource bottlenecks, role confusion, and burnout.How should you assign CS roles?? Review your current org chart and team skillsets.? For each CS segment (VIP, High touch, Mid touch, Low touch), decide which roles are needed for delivery (e.g., vCIOs for VIP, TAMs for Low touch).? Estimate, for each person, what % of their time is realistically available for CS work.Tips for data collection:? Use time tracking tools, job descriptions, or self-reported estimates to gather data.? For small MSPs, one person may wear multiple hats—document all roles per individual.What if your balance is off?? If you have too few strategic roles (e.g., only one vCIO for all VIP and High touch clients), you may need to reassign tasks, automate lower-touch segments, or plan for hiring.How can you improve CS team allocation?? Regularly review time allocation and role effectiveness during quarterly business reviews.? Adjust team structure or workload as your client portfolio evolves.
Client PortfolioWhy is this important? Knowing your client distribution by segment is the foundation for capacity planning, resource allocation, and engagement modeling. It ensures you know exactly how many clients need each type of playbook or engagement rhythm.How should you assign client counts?? Use your CRM, PSA, or billing system to extract a current list of active clients.? Group and count clients according to your segmentation logic (VIP, High touch, Mid touch, Low touch, or A–D).Tips for data collection:? Update these counts regularly (e.g., quarterly) to keep pace with growth, churn, and segment upgrades/downgrades.What if your segments are unbalanced?? If most clients are in high-touch segments, check if your team can realistically support them—otherwise, consider moving segment boundaries or redefining engagement levels.How can you improve portfolio balance?? Use this data to guide hiring, automation, and engagement model refinements.? Share the numbers in leadership reviews to support business cases for resource changes.

Part 1 – Defining the CS Role Types for MSPsIntroduction: Building a Common Language for Customer Success RolesCustomer Success in MSPs often starts as a catch-all for account management—or worse, a single person wearing all the hats. But to scale, you need clarity: a role-type framework that defines who does what, at what level, and why. Without it, critical tasks slip through the cracks, teams duplicate effort, and clients get confused about who to trust.Part 1 lays the groundwork by:? Introducing the five core CS-type roles (TAM, AM, vCIO, vCTO, vCISO)? Mapping each role across the strategic ? tactical and business ? technical axes? Highlighting what makes each role successful—and what undermines them? Showing how these roles fit together into a multi-threaded engagement engineBy the end of this section, you’ll have a clear, actionable framework to structure your CS function, assign the right people to the right conversations, and set the stage for scalable, high-impact Customer Success.
Introduction to Role Typing in Customer SuccessIn many MSPs, “Customer Success” is often misunderstood as either a generic job title or a buzzword meant to replace “Account Manager.” In reality, Customer Success is not a single role — it is a role type. It is a collection of interdependent responsibilities that, when done right, drive long-term client value, increase retention, and grow revenue. But those responsibilities are rarely handled by just one person — and they should never be left undefined.This chapter introduces a role-based model for structuring Customer Success in a Managed Service Provider (MSP) business. We call these CS-Type Roles — roles that directly contribute to driving client outcomes, creating strategic alignment, and maintaining the health of the customer relationship.Why Role Typing MattersIn small MSPs, one person (usually the owner) wears all the hats — from tech advisory and project planning to relationship management and renewals. But as the MSP grows, those functions need to separate. If they don’t, roles overlap, tasks get duplicated or dropped, and relationships become fragile.Role typing helps you:? Clarify responsibilities so nothing important gets missed or repeated? Scale customer experience consistently across different clients and team members? De-risk relationships by creating multiple, intentional touchpoints across business and technology? Match the right MSP resource to the right client persona (e.g., pairing a vCIO with the client’s CFO, not their Office Manager)? Support internal collaboration by defining who leads vs. supports on different parts of the client journeyFrom Generalist to SpecialistMost MSPs start with generalists — people who cover a wide range of responsibilities. Over time, generalists need to give way to specialists. A TAM should not be leading strategic conversations. A vCIO should not be fielding ticket escalations. Account Managers shouldn’t be writing roadmaps. That transition from “anyone can do it” to “this is your role” is what separates reactive MSPs from proactive, scalable ones.This guide introduces a clear role typing framework that allows you to grow into specialization with structure and intent. These are not arbitrary job titles. They are critical functions that serve different parts of the client lifecycle — some technical, some business, some tactical, some strategic.A Unified Language for CS RolesBy the end of this chapter, you’ll have a shared language for discussing and designing CS within your MSP. You'll understand:? The 5 Core CS-Type Roles used in modern MSPs? How each role fits across the strategic/tactical and business/technical spectrum? What success looks like for each role? How they work together without stepping on each other? Where most MSPs get stuck when roles remain blurred or informalThis foundational structure will guide not just your org chart — but your meetings, your handoffs, your hiring, and your growth strategy.
Overview of the 5 Core CS-Type RolesIn a modern MSP, delivering customer success requires more than great service. It requires structured, intentional engagement with your clients — across both business and technology, and at both tactical and strategic levels.To do that, MSPs rely on a set of specialized roles. These aren’t just job titles — they are functional roles that align with different parts of the client journey. Some are technical. Some are business-facing. Some focus on daily execution. Others focus on long-term strategy.Together, these roles make up what we call the CS Role Type family.The 5 Core CS-Type RolesEach of these roles contributes to Customer Success by helping clients achieve their business goals through the smart use of technology. Here's a high-level view:1. Technical Account Manager (TAM)Focus: Technical · Tactical The TAM ensures that client systems are aligned with best practices, standards, and lifecycle management. They perform regular reviews, audits, and check-ins to identify risks and ensure that the MSP's technical delivery is consistent and proactive.? Supports daily IT operations and service standards? Flags issues and opportunities based on recurring assessments? Maintains consistency in documentation, tools, and environments? Often the “face of service delivery” in the MSP-client relationship2. Account Manager (AM)Focus: Business · Tactical The AM maintains regular client communication, manages renewals, and ensures overall satisfaction. They handle feedback loops, coordinate service delivery issues, and maintain a healthy, predictable business relationship.? Coordinates communication and ensures clients feel supported? Manages renewals, satisfaction, and service expectations? Escalates issues and opportunities to appropriate teams? Keeps the client relationship moving forward3. Virtual CIO (vCIO)Focus: Business · Strategic The vCIO leads strategic planning for the client’s technology. They develop roadmaps, align IT with business goals, and help clients plan budgets and initiatives. The vCIO often works with owners, executives, or CFOs to guide future-focused decisions.? Leads strategic alignment and business planning? Builds roadmaps, budgets, and long-term initiatives? Translates business goals into technology investments? Serves as the executive-level voice for IT4. Virtual CTO (vCTO)Focus: Technical · Strategic The vCTO provides technical vision and innovation strategy. While the vCIO focuses on business needs, the vCTO focuses on the architecture, integrations, and emerging technologies that enable transformation.? Drives long-term technical evolution (cloud, AI, platforms, integrations)? Advises on architectural decisions and modernization? Bridges operational delivery and future-state design? Guides high-impact decisions on innovation investments5. Virtual CISO (vCISO)Focus: Business + Technical · Strategic The vCISO ensures that the client’s security posture aligns with their risk profile, regulatory requirements, and business model. They combine compliance strategy with security architecture and policy development.? Leads security strategy, risk management, and governance? Advises on compliance, frameworks, and insurance alignment? Engages with business leaders and technical stakeholders? Turns security into a business-aligned, prioritized roadmapWhy This MattersEach of these roles plays a distinct and essential part in the MSP’s ability to deliver value to clients. When clearly defined and intentionally assigned, they:? Reduce role confusion and improve accountability? Deliver the right message to the right client stakeholder? Allow specialization, seniority, and scale to emerge naturally? Support better collaboration across internal teamsIn the next section, we’ll place these roles on a simple two-axis map — showing how they span the tactical-strategic and business-technical dimensions, and what this means for your team structure.When NorthStar MSP hit 50 clients, founder Maya Patel realized something critical: every customer call went through her, whether it was a server outage or a year-end budget review. “I felt like I was playing whack-a-mole all day,” Maya recalls.After mapping her team to the five core CS-Type Roles—TAM, AM, vCIO, vCTO, and vCISO—customer escalations dropped by 40%, and renewal conversations became proactive planning sessions instead of frantic deadline chases. As Maya puts it, “Defining who owns each conversation didn’t just save my sanity—it transformed our client relationships.”Research Insight: A recent TSIA study found that MSPs with clearly defined CS roles experience 25% higher Net Dollar Retention than those with blended or undefined roles. Teams report less burnout and clients report more confidence in strategic planning.
Account Manager (AM)Focus: Business · TacticalPrimary Job to Be Done: Maintain strong client relationships, ensure ongoing satisfaction, and manage commercial aspects like renewals and feedback loops.Typical Client Persona: Office Manager, Operations Lead, Admin Coordinator, sometimes Owner (in small businesses)Role PurposeThe Account Manager (AM) is the consistent, business-facing presence in the client's day-to-day experience with the MSP. They ensure that the relationship is running smoothly, problems are addressed, and that the client sees and feels value between strategic meetings.Where the TAM handles service health and the vCIO handles long-term planning, the AM ensures ongoing trust, responsiveness, and commercial continuity. They’re the go-to for conversations like: “Are we happy with support?” or “What’s included in our contract?”Key Responsibilities? Manage the ongoing relationship health and ensure the client feels supported and valued? Handle renewals, pricing discussions, contract questions, and changes in service scope? Act as a feedback loop between the client and internal teams (e.g., service desk, TAMs, vCIO)? Track client satisfaction, NPS, and soft signals of risk or expansion? Coordinate with vCIOs and TAMs to ensure the client experience is connected and consistent? Participate in or prepare content for Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs) or regular check-insSuccess Metrics? Renewal rate and client retention? Client satisfaction / NPS scores? Number of active client touchpoints and meetings attended? Expansion conversations initiated or referred? Internal feedback from delivery teams on communication clarityWhat Makes Them Successful? Maintains a predictable meeting cadence with clients? Communicates clearly and positively, even when delivering bad news? Has a strong grasp of MSP services, agreements, and value prop? Escalates issues to the right internal resource (vCIO, TAM, or support) quickly and cleanly? Understands basic business drivers and knows how to explain IT value in non-technical termsWhat Makes Them Ineffective? Gets stuck as a "catch-all" for tickets or technical issues? Avoids uncomfortable conversations (pricing changes, dissatisfaction)? Doesn’t prepare for client meetings or ask deeper questions? Acts only reactively — shows up when there's a problem, not proactively? Fails to connect tactical updates to the client’s bigger pictureEvolution of the Role in MSP Growth? In small MSPs, this role is often absorbed by the owner or a technician with people skills.? In mid-sized MSPs, a junior AM may be hired to take on renewal coordination and basic engagement, freeing the owner or vCIO to focus on strategy.? In larger MSPs, AMs become client communication experts with defined books of business, renewal targets, and collaboration protocols with vCIOs and TAMs.Tools & Enablement? CRM or PSA with clear renewal dates, notes, and tasks? Client health dashboards or trackers? Access to agreements, QBR summaries, and service metrics? Templates for check-in emails, meeting agendas, renewal decks? Training in soft skills, MSP services, pricing models, and escalation paths“When I joined BlueWave MSP as an Account Manager, our churn rate was ticking up every quarter. In my first few weeks, I scheduled a casual check-in with a long-time client who was quietly frustrated by slow response times. By taking 15 minutes to really listen, I uncovered a backlog of minor issues that had piled up. We resolved them, restructured their support plan, and by renewal time they increased their contract by 20%. From that day on, I knew that proactive, empathetic account management doesn’t just keep customers—it helps them grow.”Research Insight: A 2024 Gainsight survey found that companies with dedicated AMs who run regular, structured check-ins see a 20% lower churn rate and a 15% increase in upsell revenue compared to those without.
Technical Account Manager (TAM)Focus: Technical · TacticalPrimary Job to Be Done: Maintain the health, compliance, and consistency of the client’s technical environment by proactively aligning systems to MSP standards.Typical Client Persona: Internal IT Contact, Office Manager, Power User, sometimes Owner (in smaller businesses)Role PurposeThe Technical Alignment Manager (TAM) is the MSP’s frontline steward of technical consistency. Their job is to ensure that the client’s environment stays in sync with industry best practices, internal MSP standards, and evolving platform baselines.Unlike helpdesk staff who react to issues, the TAM works proactively — performing recurring reviews, documenting misalignments, flagging risks, and helping drive remediation through collaboration with the vCIO or project teams.TAMs ensure that the technical foundation is solid so that strategic planning (by the vCIO or vCTO) is grounded in reality.Key Responsibilities? Conduct recurring Technical Alignment Reviews to ensure client environments meet MSP standards? Identify and document technical misalignments, risks, and gaps? Coordinate with the service team to remediate issues proactively? Maintain client documentation (hardware, software, networks, vendors, assets)? Communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical client stakeholders? Provide data and insight to vCIOs and AMs for QBRs and roadmap planningSuccess Metrics? Number and consistency of technical reviews completed? Reduction in misalignment items over time? Fewer recurring issues or service tickets tied to systemic problems? Accurate, up-to-date documentation? Client satisfaction with technical performance and stabilityWhat Makes Them Successful? Follows a structured cadence for technical reviews and reporting? Knows and applies the MSP’s standard stack, lifecycle policies, and best practices? Communicates technical findings clearly and constructively? Partners effectively with vCIOs, AMs, and service teams to resolve issues? Maintains strong documentation habits and tools disciplineWhat Makes Them Ineffective? Acts reactively (like a technician), rather than on a proactive cadence? Doesn’t communicate findings or push for remediation? Avoids difficult conversations about technical debt or client-caused issues? Lets documentation become stale or inconsistent? Doesn’t understand how misalignments affect strategic outcomes or client perceptionEvolution of the Role in MSP Growth? In very small MSPs, this work is often informal or absorbed by technicians, the owner, or the helpdesk.? In mid-sized MSPs, the TAM role emerges as a part-time function, often filled by a senior tech or project coordinator.? In larger MSPs, TAMs operate as a specialized team, with recurring review cycles, tools, alignment scorecards, and collaboration processes feeding into the CS function.Tools & Enablement? Technical Alignment Checklist or Scoring Framework? Documentation tools (e.g., IT Glue, Hudu)? PSA or platform-integrated reporting systems? Reference architecture diagrams, standards library, and best practice guides? Communication templates and internal escalation workflows? Training in structured review cadence, reporting, and non-technical communicationWhen Ellis joined TechBridge MSP as a Technical Alignment Manager, their first task was a routine infrastructure review for a mid-market finance client. Within an hour, they spotted outdated firmware on the client’s core switches—an overlooked risk that could have led to a major breach. Ellis scheduled a remediation project, updated documentation, and set a quarterly audit cadence. Six months later, when the client faced a regional cyberattack, their defenses held strong—saving them from costly downtime and earning TechBridge a glowing reference.Research Insight: Forrester reports that MSPs who implement proactive technical alignment reviews reduce unplanned outages by up to 60% and improve client satisfaction scores by 30%.
Virtual CIO (vCIO)Focus: Business · StrategicPrimary Job to Be Done: Align the client’s business goals with technology strategy through long-term planning, budgeting, and roadmap development.Typical Client Persona: CEO, CFO, Managing Partner, Executive DirectorRole PurposeThe Virtual CIO (vCIO) is the client's strategic advisor. They lead the long-term planning process, translating business objectives into actionable technology strategies. Unlike the TAM or AM, who focus on tactical operations or relationship management, the vCIO helps clients see around corners — identifying risks, aligning budgets, and building roadmaps that support business growth.The vCIO is where MSPs “enter the boardroom.” They speak the language of outcomes, not tickets or tools. Their success is measured by trust, influence, and strategic traction.Key Responsibilities? Lead strategic business-technology alignment sessions with client executives? Develop and present technology roadmaps tied to business goals and budgets? Translate technical risks and opportunities into business decisions? Guide clients through budget planning and investment cycles? Collaborate with TAMs to incorporate technical insights into strategic planning? Support AMs in renewal discussions by providing future-looking value narratives? Facilitate or lead Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs) or strategic meetingsSuccess Metrics? Number of strategic plans or roadmaps completed and adopted? Client trust and executive relationship strength? Annual budget alignment and strategic initiative approval? Presence and influence in QBRs and planning sessions? Improved technology maturity across client baseWhat Makes Them Successful? Builds strong relationships with client executives based on trust and insight? Connects business pain points with technology initiatives in plain language? Prepares and presents roadmaps that feel practical, not theoretical? Aligns tightly with TAM and AM to ensure accurate, informed strategy? Adapts communication style to non-technical audiences without losing impactWhat Makes Them Ineffective? Gets too tactical, overlapping with TAM work (e.g., tool conversations, backups)? Uses technical jargon or too much detail in executive meetings? Develops generic or unrealistic roadmaps disconnected from client context? Avoids financial conversations or strategic planning? Fails to involve the client in roadmap ownership, leading to low adoptionEvolution of the Role in MSP Growth? In small MSPs, the owner typically acts as the de facto vCIO, using their knowledge and authority to guide client planning.? In mid-sized MSPs, a part-time or shared vCIO role often emerges, supporting top-tier clients with planning and budgeting guidance.? In larger MSPs, full-time vCIOs are assigned to accounts or verticals, working in tandem with AMs and TAMs as part of a strategic account team.Tools & Enablement? Roadmap templates and strategic initiative libraries? Budget planning frameworks and financial modeling tools? Business discovery and intake tools (industry, goals, risks)? Collaboration with TAM data (assessments, documentation, misalignments)? Presentation kits for QBRs and executive conversations? Training in consultative communication, business acumen, and strategic facilitationWhen Lina García stepped into her role as vCIO at Horizon MSP, she was invited to the quarterly executive meeting of a mid-sized manufacturing client. Revenue had plateaued, and executives blamed slow technology decisions. Lina presented a concise three-year roadmap linking new automation tools to a projected 12% increase in operational efficiency. By Q2, the client had secured capital approval, deployed the first phase of the roadmap, and reported a 9% reduction in production costs. “It wasn’t about the tech,” Lina says. “It was about speaking their language—showing how each investment drives a business outcome.”Research Insight: According to IDC, MSPs offering strategic vCIO services generate 1.5? higher ROI for clients and see a 20% uplift in renewal rates, as clients view technology as a driver of growth rather than just a cost center.
Virtual CTO (vCTO)Focus: Technical · StrategicPrimary Job to Be Done: Guide the client’s long-term technology architecture, innovation strategy, and platform evolution to support growth and transformation.Typical Client Persona: CTO, IT Advisor, Senior Technical Stakeholder, or, in smaller clients, the CEO/Owner seeking modernizationRole PurposeThe Virtual CTO (vCTO) serves as the client’s long-range technology strategist. While the vCIO focuses on aligning technology to business needs, the vCTO focuses on the architecture and innovation side — how systems, platforms, and integrations can be evolved or reimagined to support future capabilities.The vCTO advises on modernization paths, evaluates emerging technologies (like AI, automation, or cloud platforms), and ensures that the client’s technology foundation is built to scale. This role is especially important for clients that are growing rapidly, undergoing transformation, or looking to unlock competitive advantage through technology.Key Responsibilities? Provide guidance on technology modernization and infrastructure evolution? Evaluate and recommend emerging technologies, platforms, and integration strategies? Translate business and industry trends into architectural recommendations? Collaborate with vCIO to ensure business goals align with future-state design? Partner with TAMs to understand operational constraints and readiness? Support complex project design or multi-system transformationsSuccess Metrics? Number and scope of strategic technology initiatives successfully launched? Influence in future-state decisions (e.g., AI adoption, platform redesigns)? Client confidence in long-term tech vision? Alignment between current stack and planned evolution? Contribution to technical planning, especially in larger/more complex clientsWhat Makes Them Successful? Understands and can explain complex architecture simply? Looks forward — always scanning for what’s next and what’s needed? Balances innovation with practical, budget-conscious recommendations? Builds credibility with technical and business stakeholders alike? Collaborates seamlessly with vCIO and TAM to ensure cohesive planningWhat Makes Them Ineffective? Over-engineers solutions or pushes tools misaligned with client maturity? Stays isolated — not engaging with business or tactical teams? Speaks too technically in strategic contexts, losing executive buy-in? Focuses more on the future than addressing current gaps? Doesn’t account for legacy systems, budget constraints, or team readinessEvolution of the Role in MSP Growth? In small MSPs, this role is typically rolled into the vCIO or owner.? In mid-sized MSPs, the vCTO may be brought in for specific projects or high-growth clients with evolving needs? In larger MSPs, the vCTO becomes a key strategic resource for verticals or segments that demand tailored technical vision, innovation planning, and platform design.Tools & Enablement? Technology stack design templates and reference architectures? AI, automation, cloud, and platform advisory tools? Strategic project scoping and modernization playbooks? Collaboration frameworks with TAM (standards) and vCIO (business plans)? Industry research and use-case libraries for innovation planning? Training in transformation strategy, technical presentation, and stakeholder alignmentRajiv Patel, acting as a Virtual CTO for Emerald Health MSP, was brought into a growing healthcare provider struggling with siloed systems—EMR, billing, and scheduling each lived on different platforms. Rajiv sketched a unified integration blueprint that phased in a shared data layer, leveraging APIs and a modular microservices approach. Six months later, the provider saw a 25% drop in administrative errors and a 35% improvement in staff productivity. “Innovation isn’t about flash—it’s about removing friction,” Rajiv reflects. “Bridging today’s needs with tomorrow’s vision is what clients pay us for.”Research Insight: A Gartner study found that MSP-led architecture modernization initiatives yield a 40% faster time-to-market for new services and reduce technical debt remediation costs by 30%.
Virtual CISO (vCISO)Focus: Business + Technical · StrategicPrimary Job to Be Done: Guide the client’s security, risk, and compliance posture by aligning business needs with cybersecurity strategy and frameworks.Typical Client Persona: COO, Compliance Officer, Owner, CFO, or Senior Manager concerned with data, risk, or regulatory impactRole PurposeThe Virtual CISO (vCISO) helps clients take a strategic approach to cybersecurity. Rather than just recommending tools or responding to incidents, the vCISO frames security as a business issue — one that involves people, process, and compliance, not just firewalls and backups.They evaluate risks, interpret compliance obligations, create security roadmaps, and guide clients through decisions that affect legal exposure, operational resilience, and reputation. The vCISO ensures that security is proactive, not reactive — and that it aligns with what the business actually needs to protect.This role is increasingly critical for regulated industries, growing clients, and those facing pressure from insurers or third-party vendors.Key Responsibilities? Lead security risk assessments and develop mitigation plans? Align cybersecurity recommendations with compliance frameworks (e.g., HIPAA, NIST, SOC 2, GDPR)? Create and maintain a security roadmap tied to business goals and priorities? Collaborate with vCIO on budgeting and with vCTO on implementation feasibility? Support incident response planning, policy creation, and cyber insurance readiness? Communicate clearly to both technical teams and business executivesSuccess Metrics? Clarity and adoption of a security roadmap? Risk reduction as measured by assessments or insurance requirements? Client trust in the MSP’s security advisory capabilities? Closed gaps in compliance posture or third-party audit readiness? Measurable maturity increases (DMI, CIS Controls, etc.)What Makes Them Successful? Balances technical expertise with risk and compliance awareness? Speaks confidently with both business and technical stakeholders? Focuses on what matters most — not securing everything, but the right things? Avoids fear tactics and builds trust through clear, proactive advice? Works closely with vCIO and vCTO to ensure execution and integrationWhat Makes Them Ineffective? Leads with fear or complexity that overwhelms the client? Pushes technical tools without context or risk justification? Avoids compliance conversations or lacks understanding of frameworks? Fails to tie security initiatives to actual business priorities? Works in a silo — not integrated with broader CS planning or deliveryEvolution of the Role in MSP Growth? In small MSPs, security is often covered informally or through vendor tools, with no strategic owner.? In mid-sized MSPs, the vCIO or TAM may try to handle security reactively, until the risk or opportunity becomes too large to ignore.? In larger MSPs, the vCISO emerges as a strategic function, leading security strategy across top clients or regulated verticals. Some MSPs even productize this role as a fractional service.Tools & Enablement? Security risk assessment templates and reporting tools? Compliance checklists and policy libraries (e.g., HIPAA, NIST)? Security roadmap templates and prioritization frameworks? Integration points with TAMs (technical risks) and vCIOs (business alignment)? Cyber insurance alignment tools and communication templates? Training in risk communication, compliance frameworks, and governance practicesWhen Michelle Tran joined SecureWave MSP as their first dedicated vCISO, she inherited a mid-market healthcare client scrambling to meet new HIPAA requirements. In her first session, Michelle mapped every data flow—from patient intake to billing—and uncovered an unsecured file share exposing sensitive records. She architected a phased security roadmap: encrypt data at rest, implement MFA, and train staff on phishing. Within three months, the client passed their audit with zero findings—and gained boardroom praise for turning compliance into a competitive advantage. “Security isn’t just defense,” Michelle says. “It’s how you build trust and grow your business.”Research Insight: A 2023 Ponemon Institute report found that MSPs providing strategic vCISO services help clients reduce breach likelihood by 50% and improve overall security posture scores by 30%.
How the Roles Fit TogetherThe five CS-type roles in an MSP aren’t just standalone functions. They form an interdependent system — each playing a different part in the client journey and in the internal delivery model. When these roles are clearly defined, properly assigned, and consistently executed, the result is a multi-threaded, scalable, and resilient client experience.But when roles are missing, unclear, or overlapped without intention, the MSP experiences bottlenecks, client confusion, and internal inefficiency.How the Roles Fit TogetherEach role is a touchpoint for a different type of client conversation, and together they form a full-spectrum engagement model:? TAM ensures that the technical environment is compliant, consistent, and up-to-date.? AM ensures the relationship stays warm, organized, and aligned with expectations.? vCIO connects business goals to technology strategy and roadmaps.? vCTO provides vision for how technical architecture and innovation evolve over time.? vCISO reduces business risk through proactive security and compliance leadership.Think of it this way:? The TAM prevents fire drills.? The AM prevents churn.? The vCIO prevents stagnation.? The vCTO prevents technical debt.? The vCISO prevents reputational and legal risk.When all roles are active and coordinated, the client feels seen, safe, and guided.Are These Roles Working?Here are some quick signals that your CS role system is functioning well:? Clients know who to go to for what, and they feel well-supported.? Internal team members don’t duplicate work or step on each other’s toes.? Strategic meetings result in decisions, not just updates.? Technical risks are flagged before they become problems.? Roadmaps are built and actually executed.? Renewals happen on time and feel earned, not automatic.On the other hand, when roles aren’t working well:? The same person is showing up to every meeting (or no one is).? Strategic meetings turn into ticket updates or sales pitches.? Projects are scoped without a roadmap or budget.? Technical debt accumulates, but no one is accountable.? AMs are confused, TAMs are overburdened, and vCIOs are reactive.The Limits of Time, Expertise, and Client LoadEven if you have the right structure on paper, the ability to execute depends on three real-world variables:1. Time If a role is shared across too many clients or departments, its value gets diluted. A part-time vCIO doing 5% of their time per client won’t build traction or trust.2. Expertise Strategic roles require seniority and judgment. A junior AM or TAM can cover the basics, but they often lack the business acumen or influence to lead strategic conversations.3. Client Volume As your client base grows, role clarity and handoff discipline become even more critical. The more clients you serve, the more scalable — and standardized — your CS role system must be.This is where many MSPs hit their first wall: they know what the roles should look like, but don’t have enough people, experience, or time to cover them all. As a result, they “merge” roles informally, hand off responsibilities inconsistently, or depend too heavily on one senior person — often the owner.This sets the stage for the next chapter, where we’ll explore how these roles actually evolve inside MSPs as they grow — and what patterns, challenges, and transitions are common at each stage of maturity.
Part 2 – The Evolution of Customer Success Teams by MSP Maturity StageIntroduction: The CS Team Is a Living SystemCustomer Success in MSPs doesn’t begin with job titles or hiring plans. It begins with people wearing many hats — often out of necessity. In early-stage MSPs, strategic planning, account management, technical alignment, and even security advice are often handled by a single person. Usually, that person is the owner.But as the business grows — more clients, more complexity, more expectations — that one-person system starts to crack. Things get missed. Strategy slips. Clients get uneven experiences. It becomes clear that CS isn't a “job” anymore. It's a system — and it needs structure.This chapter walks through how that system evolves in real life. Not as an ideal-state org chart, but as an organic journey that every growing MSP goes through. You’ll see how CS roles emerge, blend, separate, and scale as the company matures — and what needs to shift to keep the model working.
Stage 1: Solo Owner-Led CS(1–10 employees · 10–25 clients)What It Looks LikeAt this stage, the MSP owner is the CS team. They build the client relationship, design the roadmap, handle renewals, and often take part in technical service delivery. The owner plays every quadrant: TAM, AM, vCIO, vCTO — and sometimes vCISO if needed.Because the owner holds deep credibility and visibility across the business, this setup can be extremely effective — but only up to a point. It's not scalable. It’s fragile. And it depends entirely on one person.Strengths? Deep trust and strategic influence with clients? Highly personalized service? No handoffs — one brain, all the context? Fast decisions, clear authorityLimitations? Low frequency of engagement due to time constraints? No documentation or standardization? No backup if the owner is unavailable? Strategy stays in someone’s head — not shared or scalable? Choke point for growthWhat Typically Gets Missed? Regular alignment reviews (TAM function is ad hoc)? Dedicated renewal process or account planning? Formal roadmaps or documented strategic plans? Internal handoff processesEarly Warning Signs? Owner is late to or skipping meetings? Strategy conversations become reactive or shallow? Clients start escalating basic questions? No time for proactive or quarterly planningWhat’s Needed to Move Forward? Hire a junior Account Manager to begin offloading communications and renewals? Start documenting technical environments and client goals? Implement a basic CRM or PSA to track touchpoints and cadence? Introduce a simple cadence: review, roadmap, renewAt CedarTech MSP, founder and CEO Marcus Lee managed every aspect of client engagement—from troubleshooting server crashes at midnight to presenting annual IT budgets. “Clients loved having me on speed dial,” Marcus recalls, “but I was exhausted, and we couldn’t take on new accounts without burning out.” When a key client experienced a major outage at the same time Marcus was on vacation, response lagged and trust took a hit. That incident spurred CedarTech’s first hire: a dedicated Account Manager to share the load and ensure coverage—even when Marcus wasn’t available.Research Insight: A Harvard Business Review case study found that small firms where the owner handles all client interactions see 30% slower growth and 25% higher staff turnover compared to those that begin delegating early.
Stage 2: The Augmented Owner Model(10–25 employees · 25–75 clients)What It Looks LikeThe MSP is growing, and the owner can no longer handle every strategic conversation, renewal, and technical check-in alone. At this stage, the business begins to “augment” the owner — hiring supporting team members who take over portions of Customer Success activity.But here's the reality: roles aren’t clearly defined yet. Instead, CS work is distributed among available people based on availability, experience, and comfort — not by strategic design. A senior tech might run a QBR. A helpdesk lead might talk renewals. An AM might handle documentation. It’s messy, but it’s forward movement.This is the most blended and ambiguous phase of CS maturity. Everyone is helping, but no one owns it cleanly. And without clarity, coverage becomes inconsistent — which risks client trust as the business scales.Strengths? Begins to free up owner time? Clients receive more attention and structured communication? Some documentation and tools are introduced? Strategic planning begins to take shape, though inconsistentlyLimitations? No full-time CS ownership — only part-time or borrowed capacity? Roles overlap, creating confusion or gaps? Limited seniority in CS-facing team members? Technical and business conversations still get mixed or misalignedWhat Typically Gets Missed? Consistent renewal tracking or account-level forecasting? True proactive technical alignment reviews? Role-based meeting preparation or follow-up? Intentional pairing of MSP roles to client personasEarly Warning Signs? Clients don’t know who to contact for what? Strategic meetings bounce between tactical topics? The owner is still pulled back in “for the important ones”? Internal team members are unclear on who owns roadmap, QBR, or renewalWhat’s Needed to Move Forward? Designate a dedicated Account Manager or Client Success Coordinator? Clearly split CS responsibilities between AM, TAM, and vCIO (even if shared)? Introduce internal playbooks for QBRs, renewals, and roadmap planning? Begin mapping MSP roles to client personas (who talks to who)? Use CRM, PSA, or CS platform to track cadence, not just ticketsWhen Concord MSP hit 30 active clients, CEO Tara Nguyen realized she was fielding every client email—even simple status updates. To lighten her load, she hired her first Account Manager, Alex, who took over all routine check-ins and renewal conversations. “At first, I thought I’d lose the personal touch,” Tara admits. “But clients actually felt more supported—Alex brought structure and follow-through I simply couldn’t sustain alone.” Within two quarters, client satisfaction scores rose 18% and Tara reclaimed an extra 10 hours per month to focus on strategic growth.Research Insight: A 2023 TSIA report shows that MSPs augmenting founder-led CS with a dedicated AM see a 15% reduction in response times and a 12% increase in client satisfaction within six months.
Stage 3: Emerging Role Separation(25–50 employees · 75–200 clients)What It Looks LikeAt this stage, the MSP begins to formally separate CS responsibilities into distinct roles. The owner is no longer central to every strategic conversation. There are now full-time team members assigned to CS-type responsibilities — typically an Account Manager (AM), and either a dedicated vCIO or a more senior AM/vCIO hybrid.The team starts to feel like a “real” Customer Success function, even if titles are still flexible. Tactical (TAM) and strategic (vCIO) activities begin to separate. The AM becomes the consistent voice between client and MSP, while the vCIO focuses on planning, budgeting, and guidance. The TAM role may still be shared between project engineers or service leads, but processes are forming.This is where structure meets scale — but it requires discipline to avoid regressing into role confusion.Strengths? Clients have named contacts and start to experience a reliable rhythm? First real handoffs between roles (AM ? vCIO ? TAM) begin? Roadmaps and QBRs are standardized across accounts? Owner or senior leaders focus on the highest-value relationships or oversightLimitations? Partial role overlap still occurs (especially vCIO and AM)? TAM function may remain underdeveloped or informal? Strategic execution may lag if vCIO lacks influence or tools? CS performance may still rely on heroics vs. processWhat Typically Gets Missed? Clear success criteria or KPIs for each CS role? Scalable onboarding and training for new CS staff? Separation of internal CS planning vs. external execution? Role-based governance or internal accountability rhythmsEarly Warning Signs? Team members struggle with “who leads this meeting?”? Clients escalate to the wrong person or get mixed messages? Roadmaps are created but not executed? QBRs feel like updates, not planning conversationsWhat’s Needed to Move Forward? Hire or promote a full-time vCIO or Strategic Advisor? Define formal role scopes for AM, TAM, vCIO? Train team on “who owns what” in the client lifecycle? Create internal cadence documents and handoff checkpoints? Begin tracking role-based performance (e.g., roadmap adoption, health score coverage, renewal confidence)At Orion MSP, leadership hired their first full-time vCIO and dedicated Account Manager to relieve founder Eddie Chen. But initial handoffs were clumsy—roadmaps drafted by the vCIO stalled because the AM didn’t know where to surface next steps, and the TAM wasn’t looped in until tickets piled up. After one client threatened to walk, Orion introduced a simple “handoff huddle” before every Quarterly Business Review. Now, the vCIO, AM, and TAM meet for 15 minutes beforehand to align on talking points, responsibilities, and follow-up actions. Since then, roadmap execution has jumped 50%, and client feedback on meeting clarity has doubled.Research Insight: A recent TSIA benchmark found that MSPs transitioning to clear role separation—and adopting structured handoff rituals—increase strategic initiative completion by 40% and reduce service escalations by 30%.
Stage 4: Functional Team Model(50–100 employees · 200–500 clients)What It Looks LikeAt this stage, the MSP has transitioned from shared responsibilities to a fully structured CS team, with each role operating as a distinct function. The TAM, AM, and vCIO roles are clearly defined, assigned by segment or vertical, and work together through structured internal cadences.The CS team no longer just reacts to clients — they run a program. There's internal governance, playbooks, QBR templates, and performance metrics. Handoffs are consistent. Roadmaps get executed. Feedback flows across functions. At this point, CS is no longer a scattered set of activities — it's a system with process, rhythm, and ownership.Some MSPs in this stage introduce vCTO and vCISO roles either as part of their service offerings (especially in vertical markets like healthcare, legal, or finance), or as embedded advisors for higher-tier accounts.Strengths? Each CS-type role is staffed and scoped? Strategic and tactical conversations are separated, but connected? Internal collaboration across roles improves client outcomes? Executive visibility into CS performance increases? Clients see MSP as a proactive, strategic partnerLimitations? Higher headcount increases coordination overhead? Roles may become too siloed if not aligned under shared leadership? Performance may vary across client segments if enablement isn’t consistent? Strategic planning can outpace delivery if projects or resourcing fall behindWhat Typically Gets Missed? A formal leadership layer to coach, manage, and align CS roles? Time for CS team members to meet, plan, and learn from each other? Maturity-based playbooks (e.g., how vCIOs engage with a Level 2 vs. Level 4 client)? Integration of CS metrics with overall business performanceEarly Warning Signs? vCIOs or AMs feeling isolated or stretched? Client experience varies widely depending on the assigned team? Great strategy, but weak follow-through (disconnect between plan and delivery)? Overlap or confusion between vCTO and vCIO scopesWhat’s Needed to Move Forward? Hire or designate a CS Leader (Head of CS, VP Success, or Director)? Establish internal governance and operating rhythm (1:1s, dashboards, review meetings)? Implement role-specific onboarding, training, and KPIs? Use segment-based planning and reporting (e.g., strategic clients vs. transactional ones)? Begin defining and standardizing the client journey by role and tierAt Meridian MSP, rapid growth pushed them into a 50–employee operation serving 300 clients. They’d hired dedicated TAMs, AMs, and vCIOs, but without a unifying structure, each team operated in its own rhythm—clients got the right advice, just in the wrong order. When a major retail client complained about inconsistent follow-through, Meridian appointed a Director of Customer Success to “conduct the band.” Within weeks, Meridian rolled out shared playbooks, weekly syncs, and role-specific KPIs. Suddenly, QBRs ran like clockwork, roadmaps transitioned seamlessly into projects, and client NPS climbed 15 points in one quarter.Research Insight: A 2024 Gartner survey found that MSPs with a formal CS leadership role and standardized internal cadences see a 20% increase in customer health scores and a 25% reduction in service escalations compared to those without.
Stage 5: Mature CS Organization with Leadership Layer(100+ employees · 500+ clients or multiple business units/products)What It Looks LikeAt this level, Customer Success is a dedicated business function with its own leadership, metrics, operating rhythm, and strategic charter. The MSP has built not just CS roles — but a CS organization, typically reporting into a VP or Head of Customer Success, or integrated with a broader Client Experience or Revenue Operations function.All core roles (TAM, AM, vCIO) are staffed, scoped, and operating within a unified CS model. Strategic roles like vCTO and vCISO are deployed as fractional or dedicated advisors depending on client complexity, vertical, or contract level.The CS team has evolved from delivery support to a revenue-impacting unit, tied directly to client retention, Net Dollar Retention (NDR), and strategic initiative execution. There is a high degree of process standardization, performance measurement, and internal collaboration.This is where MSPs become truly scalable — with a repeatable client journey, embedded value creation, and role-driven relationships that survive turnover and team changes.Strengths? Strategic and tactical roles are fully staffed, enabled, and measured? CS performance is tied to business performance (retention, expansion, maturity)? Clients engage with multiple trusted advisors, not just a single “main contact”? Clear career paths and role development for CS professionals? Proactive, data-driven decision-making supported by CS insights and reportingLimitations? Complexity of managing multiple layers of CS coordination? Risk of bureaucracy or slow decision-making without strong leadership? Requires ongoing investment in systems, tools, and enablement? Harder to maintain consistency across regions, verticals, or product linesWhat Typically Gets Missed? Tight alignment between CS and Product or Sales teams? Continuous refinement of CS roles as service offerings evolve? Scalable onboarding for new CS team members? Feedback loops from CS into roadmap or go-to-market strategyEarly Warning Signs? Misalignment between CS metrics and executive KPIs? CS team execution slows due to over-standardization or internal red tape? Clients start to feel the weight of “too many contacts” or unclear ownership? Strategic insights aren’t flowing back into product or delivery teamsWhat’s Needed to Sustain and Scale? Formal CS leadership structure (director, manager, team leads by segment or function)? Integrated performance dashboards for client health, roadmap execution, and initiative impact? Regular cross-functional alignment (Product, Sales, Delivery, CS)? Career paths, certifications, and retention plans for CS staff? A continuous improvement model — CS evolves as your clients doAt BrightLayer MSP, Customer Success was once a back-office function supporting renewals and ticket escalations. But as they crossed 500 clients, leadership realized CS could no longer hide in the shadows. They appointed a VP of Customer Success, integrated CS metrics into the executive dashboard, and built formal feedback loops with Sales and Product. Within two quarters, churn dropped 8%, upsell velocity rose 22%, and CS-driven product enhancements cut time-to-market for new features by 30%. As VP Sandra Kim reflects, “When CS earned its seat at the table, we stopped reacting to problems and started driving the business forward.”Research Insight: A Forrester study shows that organizations with dedicated CS leadership and integrated cross-functional cadences achieve 26% higher Net Dollar Retention and 18% faster feature adoption than those without strategic CS alignment.
Part 3 – Making Transitions Between Maturity StagesIntroduction: Growth Without Breaking What WorksEvery MSP wants to grow — more clients, more revenue, more recurring value. But growth isn’t just about volume. It’s about reliably delivering outcomes at scale, and that only happens when Customer Success evolves in step with the business.Most MSPs don’t struggle because they lack talent or good intentions. They struggle because they grow without shifting structure. They wait too long to hire, keep CS responsibilities ambiguous, or push high-impact conversations onto the wrong roles. The result? Burnout, missed renewals, stalled roadmaps, and fragile client relationships.This chapter provides a practical guide for moving between stages. At each inflection point, we’ll highlight:? The trigger signs it’s time to level up? The key hires, tools, or processes required to grow without breaking? What to let go of, what to keep, and what to addIf Part 2 showed you how CS teams naturally evolve, Part 3 shows you how to move through those phases with clarity and control.
Transition 1: From Solo Owner to Augmented Owner(Stage 1 ? Stage 2)What Triggers This Transition? The owner is skipping or winging strategic meetings? Clients are beginning to experience inconsistent service or communication? There’s no time to prepare for QBRs, follow up, or document roadmaps? Revenue is growing, but relationship depth is shrinking? The owner wants to focus on business development or operationsWhat’s Needed to Move Forward1. Hire or designate a junior Account Manager? This person doesn’t need to be senior — they need to be structured, responsive, and relationship-minded? Their job is to track renewals, keep communication warm, and escalate issues internally? It’s not about replacing the owner — it’s about supporting them2. Introduce a basic CRM or PSA for CS? Even if it’s simple, you need a way to track:? Last meeting? Next planned meeting? Open risks or opportunities? Renewal date? This ensures continuity when the owner is unavailable3. Create a light-touch cadence framework? Define what “minimum CS touch” looks like? E.g., One client check-in per quarter? One strategic initiative per year? Create calendar holds and basic agendas4. Start documenting technical and business context? Introduce client profiles, asset documentation, and goal summaries? Use tools like IT Glue, Hudu, or internal docs5. Align internal delivery with client rhythm? Even if the TAM function doesn’t exist yet, assign someone (project lead, tech, owner) to provide inputs to CS? Don’t let CS run in a vacuum — use delivery data to inform the client conversationWhat to Let Go Of? Owner attending every meeting or handling every renewal? Informal, memory-based account knowledge? The idea that “clients only trust me” — trust is transferable with the right structureWhat to Keep? Owner participation in top-tier or high-risk accounts? Strategic insight into client goals and feedback? The human, relationship-first approach that made early growth possibleWhen FusionPoint MSP hit its 25-client threshold, founder Diego Ramirez realized he was the linchpin for every client interaction—from emergency ticket fixes at midnight to creating annual IT roadmaps. Clients loved his dedication, but Diego was running on fumes. In a bold move, he hired his first Account Manager, Priya Singh, to handle routine check-ins and renewal conversations. “Handing off felt like letting go of a part of my business,” Diego admits. “But watching Priya thrive—and seeing clients get faster, more consistent support—reminded me that scaling means sharing success.”Research Insight: A 2023 MSPAlliance whitepaper found that MSPs delegating client-facing tasks early see a 20% boost in founder capacity and a 15% improvement in client satisfaction within the first quarter post-hire.
Transition 2: From Augmented Owner to Emerging Role Separation(Stage 2 ? Stage 3)What Triggers This Transition? CS tasks are getting dropped, duplicated, or delayed? The Account Manager is overwhelmed or unclear on what they truly own? The owner is still heavily involved in strategic client conversations? There’s inconsistency across accounts — some get roadmaps, others don’t? Roadmaps are created, but no one owns follow-throughThis is the moment when your MSP must stop sharing CS tasks across available people and start assigning CS roles to dedicated people.What’s Needed to Move Forward1. Hire or promote a full-time vCIO (or Strategic Advisor)? This person leads roadmaps, facilitates QBRs, and owns long-term client alignment? They don’t need to be deeply technical — but they must be consultative, credible, and business-savvy? Often promoted from senior tech, team lead, or owner proxy2. Formalize the TAM function (even if part-time)? Assign a consistent technical contact who owns documentation, reviews, and standard alignment? Doesn’t have to be a new hire — can be a senior tech, project coordinator, or services lead? Provide a checklist, cadence, and expectations for engagement3. Clarify CS role scopes and handoffs? Who owns the QBR?? Who builds the roadmap?? Who follows up on initiatives?? Write down the “lanes” so your team can stay in them4. Build internal collaboration rhythms? AM + vCIO weekly check-in on client health? TAM + vCIO alignment review before QBR? Shared CS notes, planning documents, and status boards5. Introduce client segmentation and touch models? Begin grouping clients into tiers or profiles (e.g., Strategic, Standard, Lite)? Define meeting cadences, roadmap depth, and initiative volume per tier? This will prevent over-servicing and under-servicing as you scaleWhat to Let Go Of? One-size-fits-all CS delivery? Strategic conversations handled by whoever is available? Reliance on owner “jumping in” to save accountsWhat to Keep? Flexible mindset — not every role needs to be perfect out of the gate? Internal collaboration — success still depends on shared context? Focus on value delivery — it’s not about meetings, it’s about outcomesAt SilverLine MSP, the owner had recently hired an Account Manager to handle renewals, but strategic and technical tasks still bounced between whoever was available. Roadmaps collected dust, and clients complained about mixed messages. Recognizing the chaos, SilverLine promoted a senior engineer, Carlos Mendoza, into a dedicated vCIO role and formally assigned their lead technician, Ava Liu, to the TAM cadence. Within two months, clients saw consistent quarterly roadmaps, technical alignment reviews happened on schedule, and handoffs became seamless. One client even remarked, “It feels like we finally have specialists for every conversation.”Research Insight: According to a 2024 TSIA benchmark, MSPs that establish full-time vCIO and TAM roles reduce project delays by 35% and improve client-reported clarity of service by 28%.
Transition 3: From Emerging Role Separation to Functional Team Model(Stage 3 ? Stage 4)What Triggers This Transition? You have full-time AMs, vCIOs, and possibly TAMs — but coordination is inconsistent? Client experience varies widely depending on who’s assigned? Strategic initiatives are proposed but often stall in execution? Some roles are operating well, while others are struggling to keep up? You can’t tell, at scale, whether your CS function is truly driving retention or expansionThis is the moment when your MSP needs to stop relying on individual role execution and start building a cohesive, systematized CS team — with process, leadership, and performance visibility.What’s Needed to Move Forward1. Appoint a CS Leader? Designate a Head of CS, Director, or CS Manager who owns the function end-to-end? They don’t need to be the most experienced CSM — they need to build team structure, enforce process, and develop people? This leader becomes the integrator across TAM, AM, and vCIO workstreams2. Implement internal governance and operating rhythm? Weekly CS team meetings? Monthly leadership syncs with Sales, Projects, and Service? Quarterly CS performance reviews? Shared goals, KPIs, and dashboards across roles3. Standardize playbooks, templates, and success criteria? Define what a good QBR looks like? Build templates for roadmaps, initiative trackers, risk logs? Set KPIs by role: initiative adoption (vCIO), roadmap execution (TAM), renewal rate (AM)4. Develop onboarding and enablement programs? New AMs and vCIOs should follow a 30–60–90-day onboarding path? Define certification levels or internal “maturity markers” for CS performance? Build role-specific training, shadowing, and peer review cycles5. Align CS work to client segments and lifecycle stages? Strategic clients get more frequent, higher-touch engagement? Standard clients follow a simplified cadence and asset package? Build the CS journey from onboarding to roadmap to renewal — and make it repeatableWhat to Let Go Of? Hero-mode success stories (i.e., individual brilliance instead of team consistency)? Role silos that prevent collaboration or context sharing? Ad hoc performance reviews or one-size-fits-all expectationsWhat to Keep? Client-first culture and responsiveness? Flexibility in how roles adapt to different client needs? Strategic alignment with the CEO or COO — CS is now a business function, not just a delivery teamAt SummitEdge MSP, dedicated TAMs, AMs, and vCIOs had been in place for months—but each team ran its own playbook, and clients felt the gaps. One retail client complained that their roadmap decisions never translated into technical follow-through. SummitEdge responded by promoting Leila Carter to Director of Customer Success—a single point person tasked with stitching the functions together. Within weeks, Leila rolled out unified playbooks, established weekly syncs between TAM, AM, and vCIO, and introduced role-specific KPIs. Six months later, the client reported a 50% improvement in project delivery time and a 20-point jump in NPS.Research Insight: A 2024 TSIA benchmark shows that MSPs introducing formal CS leadership and cross-role governance see strategic initiative completion rates rise by 40% and service escalations drop by 30%.
Transition 4: From Functional Team Model to Mature CS Organization(Stage 4 ? Stage 5)What Triggers This Transition? You have the roles, the rhythm, and the team — but you're hitting organizational limits? There’s no clear owner for CS strategy at the executive level? CS metrics (health, maturity, retention) are disconnected from company OKRs? CS teams operate well, but feedback loops with Product, Sales, and Delivery are inconsistent? You’re entering multi-product, multi-vertical, or multi-region operations — and things feel misalignedAt this level, Customer Success must evolve from a functional team to a business unit — with strategic ownership, integrated systems, and executive visibility. This is where CS shifts from being “something we do” to “how we win.”What’s Needed to Move Forward1. Appoint formal CS leadership at the strategic level? Title may be Head of CS, VP of Client Experience, or part of a Chief Customer Officer role? This person owns the CS roadmap, internal alignment, hiring, enablement, and results? Their seat at the leadership table gives CS a voice in company direction, not just execution2. Build cross-functional CS integration? Create structured feedback loops with Product (via insights, health trends, roadmap adoption)? Partner with Sales to support upsell motions and post-sale alignment? Connect CS and Delivery to streamline initiative execution and accountability3. Invest in systems and intelligence? Implement Customer Success Platforms (e.g., Gainsight, ClientSuccess, ScalePad Hub)? Develop unified client health scoring, maturity tracking, and engagement dashboards? Use data to prioritize at-risk accounts, growth opportunities, and CS team performance4. Define career paths, performance tiers, and compensation models? Avoid role stagnation — provide senior, principal, or leadership tracks for AMs, vCIOs, etc.? Tie compensation to retention, initiative success, and client health, not just activity? Build succession planning into CS team design5. Establish CS as a strategic business pillar? Include CS metrics in board-level and executive performance reporting? Make CS input a required step in product launches, marketing initiatives, and service design? Evolve CS team capabilities to match new offerings (e.g., AI, compliance, modernization)What to Let Go Of? Departmental silos — CS now works across every part of the business? Legacy roles or structures that don’t match current service model? Measuring CS by volume of activity rather than quality of impactWhat to Keep? The client-centric mindset and proactive approach that built trust? Agile, iterative planning that adapts CS to new client needs? The unified goal of helping clients succeed — and tying that success to your ownThis brings us to the end of Part 3. In this section, we’ve outlined the key transitions MSPs must navigate to build scalable, role-based, high-impact Customer Success teams — without burning out staff or diluting the client experience.You now have the framework to recognize where you are, see what’s coming next, and plan for it deliberately.At NexusPoint MSP, Customer Success was a well-oiled machine—playbooks followed, handoffs occurred, and clients reported high satisfaction. Yet, when sales cycles slowed, leadership realized CS insights weren’t influencing product development or go-to-market strategy. That changed when NexusPoint appointed a Chief Customer Officer, Maya Roberts, who paired CS health dashboards with executive OKRs. Suddenly, CS data drove feature prioritization, marketing campaigns, and even sales compensation plans. Within two quarters, average deal size grew by 18%, and churn decreased by 12%. As Maya reflects, “When CS became a strategic pillar, everyone won—from our customers to our bottom line.”Research Insight: A 2025 Forrester report found that companies with CS in the C-suite see 1.8? higher revenue growth and 1.5? lower churn than those with CS as a mid-level function.
Conclusion: Build What Comes Next — On PurposeThe evolution of Customer Success in MSPs doesn’t happen overnight. It happens deal by deal, hire by hire, and quarter by quarter. But it doesn’t need to happen by accident.By understanding the 5 CS-type roles — and how they emerge, separate, and scale as your MSP grows — you can begin to design a system that delivers consistent outcomes, proactive planning, and long-term value to your clients.These transitions aren’t just operational milestones. They are strategic inflection points:? Where you shift from being reactive to proactive? From people-dependent to process-driven? From retention-as-luck to retention-as-a-functionGrowth without role clarity leads to burnout. Structure without purpose leads to bureaucracy. But when you align people, process, and strategy — that’s when Customer Success becomes a force multiplier.Where to Go From Here1. Assess your current maturity stage. Are you still owner-led? Mid-transition? Ready for a formal leadership layer? Name your stage honestly.2. Map your CS roles. Who owns what today — really? Are roles documented, intentional, and enabled?3. Design your next transition. Whether it’s your first AM, a full-time vCIO, or a CS leader — plan the move. Don’t wait for a client to leave to realize what was missing.4. Scale with systems, not heroics. Build documentation, cadences, and reporting before you need them. Scale is a process, not a person.Final ThoughtCustomer Success is not a department. It’s how modern MSPs win — by building trust, delivering value, and guiding clients through change. When done right, it doesn’t just protect revenue — it creates it.You don’t have to be big to start. You just have to start with clarity.
Roadmap
Customer Success for MSP RoadmapThe Customer Success for MSP Manifesto has been completed, establishing the fundamental strategic direction for the framework. Alongside this, the framework now includes six disciplines, each supported by six blueprints, which together define a general operating principle for Customer Success within the MSP context.Development will continue along two main directions:? Horizontal development: Refining the framework by improving precision and consistency across its components.? Vertical development: Expanding each blueprint to include practical implementation support alongside theoretical descriptions. For example, the Meetings blueprint within the CS Process discipline currently outlines theoretical aspects but lacks detailed practical guidance for activities such as Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs) or annual planning.StageDescriptionStatusManifesto CompletionCustomer Success for MSP Manifesto finalized, defining core strategic direction.CompletedFramework DevelopmentDeveloped six disciplines and 36 blueprints outlining general operating principles.
